All of them focus on scoring you based on how well you can emulate the pitch and cadence of the original song. But actual karaoke, actually getting up and singing songs has very little to do with how well you can sing like the dude from Creed or whatever. It's about embarrassment. It's about self-deprecation. It's about making a song your own. It's about public drunkenness. It's about jumping out of your seat like a lunatic and rushing to whatever passes for a stage because your friend just got up to sing <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic; ">Build Me Up Buttercup</span>. Back on the PlayStation 2, Sony's SingStar series was popular, but it only provided the basic ability to judge your singing. But on the PlayStation 3, it provides something that more closely resembles what karaoke is all about.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12081-singstar_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12081" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12081-singstar_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12081"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12081-singstar_09.jpg"/></a><figcaption>It's Nastytime!</figcaption></figure>Of course, the basic concept of SingStar hasn't really changed. The game provides players with songs to sing, and an on-screen display shows you the pitches you should be hitting and the words you should sing. The closer you get to this, the higher your score. You can sing by yourself or with another player. At the end of a song, your score is saved to a local leaderboard.</div><div><br/></div><div>Sounds pretty normal, to the point of being boring. That's why it's a good thing that SingStar on the PlayStation 3 makes use of the PlayStation Eye camera and the console's online abilities to create a community of people, around the world, singing songs and uploading 30-second clips of the performances to a central server. In the game's online area, you can create and edit your profile and dig through the profiles of others and watch them sing. That sounds pretty standard and not all that exciting, and I was pretty skeptical about the whole thing at first, but once you dive in and start watching what people are uploading, it's easy to get absolutely hooked.</div><div><br/></div><div>The My SingStar Online section quickly turns into one of those revelatory moments where technology makes the world seem just a little smaller. This becomes especially noticeable when you start looking at the list of latest uploads, which is full of people from around the world, and they're doing more than just singing. The best videos are brief performance pieces, from the trio of guys who re-enact a piece of a Supergrass video, to the guy in the UK who dons a Chewbacca costume and dances around to the Scissor Sisters, to the two girls who sing innocently while their boyfriends sneak up from behind and dump water on their heads, to the American kid singing Natalie Imbruglia while dressed up like a Ghostbuster, these videos feel like a window into living rooms from around the world.</div><div><br/></div><div>The videos are automatically created whenever you play. Each song has a specific 30-second section that's recorded, and an on-screen icon lets you know when the camera is rolling. At the end of each performance, you can go through and watch your clip, listen to the audio portion of your performance, and look at ten snapshots that are taken over the course of the song. You can opt to save any of those to your hard drive. From the saved media area, you can choose to upload your clips for the rest of the world to see. Content can be rated on a five-star scale, and it's easy to check how many views and the rating of your stuff from your online profile page. With all of this going on, the game's scoring system seems irrelevant--the judgment of your peers feels way more interesting and, unlike that dopey computer, other humans can judge you on style.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12078-singstar_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12078" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12078-singstar_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12078"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12078-singstar_06.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Watch out for this idiot.</figcaption></figure>The constant with all music games is that they live and die by the quality and quantity of their song list. Previous SingStar games have been broken up by genre, letting the country fans sing country in peace without having to deal with any rock or rap. The PS3 version of SingStar attempts to throw multiple genres together, which means you probably won't like every single song in the game. There are 30 songs on the disc from artists like Amy Winehouse, Beck, David Bowie, OutKast, Pixies, The Cardigans, Warrant, and Weezer. But you can also get online and buy additional songs for $1.49 each. The downloads are usually around 60MB each, and you get the song, as well as a version of the music video that has been cut up a bit to work on a 16:9 screen. The game launched with 200 songs already available.</div><div><br/></div><div>There are a couple warnings to consider when purchasing SingStar and buying songs out of the online store. For starters, your online purchases are locked to the PS3 that downloads them. So if you want to bring songs to a friend's house, be prepared to pack up your PS3. Also, the game only works with Sony's SingStar microphones. If you have a Rock Band mic or any other USB microphone, you're still out of luck. If you have SingStar mics from any of the PS2 releases, however, you're set. If not, the game is offered in two pacakges, one with mics and one without.</div><div><br/></div><div>Now, some of you are undoubtedly super-shy and would never dream of letting the world see you, in your bedroom, singing. That's fine. But if you're a little more extroverted and want a sanctioned location to look like a jackass, or if creatively creating 30-second videos to the delight or disgust of an online audience is up your alley, SingStar is kind of amazing. Just don't rock a Kangol hat and a wrestling belt when you sing--that's my thing.</div></div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20462/]]></api_detail_url><id>20462</id><name><![CDATA[SingStar]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/singstar/3030-20462/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-23 13:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72372/]]></api_detail_url><id>72372</id><name><![CDATA[SingStar]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/singstar-review/1900-1/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-2/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Haze ticks most of the boxes on the "things a first-person shooter should have" form, but doesn't do so in a particularly interesting way.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p>Haze attempts to deal with the concept of wartime propaganda and how troop morale is the most important thing an army can have. But it does it in such a blatant way that it’s hard to care about the point the game’s story is trying to make. Tack on a short campaign, dull weapons, lame enemy artificial intelligence, and lackluster multiplayer options and you’re left with a game that occasionally looks nice, but not much else.</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10937-haze-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10937" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10937-haze-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10937"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/10937-haze-01.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Future drugs make your vision pulsate... hey, just like today's drugs!</figcaption></figure><p>The game opens with a brief setup monologue from its protagonist, Shane Carpenter. Carpenter is a sergeant in the employ of the Mantel Corporation, some sort of futuristic government-like entity. You, with the rest of the Mantel forces, are in a South American region to fight against a dictator that your side has nicknamed Skin Coat because of his apparent proclivities for skinning and eating people. So you’re saving lives, right? The rest of your troop seems to think so. Right away, you’re introduced to a Mantel squad, a group of meat-headed soldiers who flip between talking about the great thing they’re doing for the people of this country, giving each other high fives, and generally bro’ing out.</p><p>Now, that’s not that different than the sort of macho stereotypes you’ve come to expect from these sorts of in-game situations. The difference is that these guys are jacked up on future drugs! The drug of choice for the Mantel guys is called Nectar, and when you’re on it, you can move faster, shoot straighter, and generally avoid thinking about the horrors of war. It’s built into the suits of the troopers and fed out at a constant rate by their leaders. The game quickly lets you know that the Mantel forces are all, essentially, a bunch of junkies–even if the game’s often-inaccurate subtitles claim that the characters are really calling each other “jacknecks” instead of “junkies.” Either way, right off the bat you get the impression that you’re on the wrong side of the conflict, and just like the back of the box and every single piece of pre-release hype that Ubisoft has produced says, you switch sides pretty quickly.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10938-haze-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10938" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10938-haze-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10938"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/10938-haze-04.jpg"/></a><figcaption>These Mantel troopers are way into "the grass."</figcaption></figure><p>When you finally enter combat after a lengthy intro, you’re thrown into a mostly-competent first-person shooter without a lot of weapon variety and few special features specific to which faction you’re currently fighting for. As a Mantel trooper, you get the ability to juice yourself up with Nectar. When you do, all the enemies start to glow, making them a little easier to pick out. You recover health more quickly, move a bit faster, and while the game claims you’ll be more accurate with your shots, I wasn’t really having any trouble in that department to begin with. The danger is that if you hold down the drug button too long, you’ll overdose and your gun will start to shoot all by itself and you’ll generally freak out for a few seconds.</p><p>By comparison, the rebel fighters of the Promise Hand don’t use Nectar, but they have an ability that exploits the weaknesses of the drug. Apparently Nectar is designed to prevent users from seeing the horrors of war… like dead bodies. So the main skill you have is playing dead, which you can do whenever you take any damage with no penalty as to how often you can use it. This sort of makes you invincible, provided you play dead long enough for the enemy to spread out. You can also dive by double-tapping jump, but this never seemed useful. You can also steal weapons from enemies, but aside from the one time that the game forces you to do it and sets everything up perfectly for you to do so, there’s no need to do that. There’s plenty of ammo around.</p><p>Ammo’s rarely an issue because there are only a few different types of guns out there. You start out with an assault rifle and you occasionally encounter enemies wielding flamethrowers, shotguns, or rockets. But, if I had to make some kind of ballpark estimate, I’d say 90 percent of the enemies you fight have a standard assault rifle. Five percent have a shotgun, and the remaining five gives you the occasional flamethrower or other weapon. So the assault rifle you start with is the same assault rifle you’ll probably use at the game’s anti-climactic final confrontation. It took me around five hours to play through from start to finish on the game’s default difficulty. On the higher settings, you take more damage from enemy shots and seem to deal a little less damage with your own.</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10939-haze-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10939" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10939-haze-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10939"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/10939-haze-03.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/10939-haze-03.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Third tired drug reference goes right about here!</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to playing alone, you can play the campaign in co-op mode with up to three additional players online. The game doesn’t adjust any of the cutscenes when you play this way, so everyone is Shane Carpenter. This makes the whole mode feel thrown together, as do the occasional bugs, like seeing other players seemingly hovering in mid-air. There’s also a more traditional 16-player multiplayer mode, but with three basic modes (deathmatch, team deathmatch, and assault) and six maps (with small and large configurations), there’s not much to see here. The multiplayer plays off of the strengths and weaknesses of the two sides, so rebels can play dead and confound Mantel troops, which seems way more powerful than the minimal bonuses that Nectar confers.</p><p>Visually, parts of Haze look good. The game does jungle pretty well, though you won’t be ripping apart the foliage with gunfire and grenades or anything like that. Once you get into town or other areas, the game sports some textures that look pretty ugly up close. The audio is filled with speech from the other troops on the field, though they all repeat themselves very frequently, which makes it a very grating experience. For what it’s worth, I don’t think I heard the Korn song that seems to be getting more press than the game it’s based on once. I was surprised that it didn’t play over the end credits. Instead, the game has a collection of typical action game music during the campaign. In multiplayer, the game likes to loop a bunch of embarrassingly-rote hip-hop over the menus, the gameplay, everything. Hearing one song over and over for 20 minutes just seems like a bug, straight-up.</p><p>Playing Haze left me disappointed, for sure, but it also left me extremely curious about its development. Free Radical, the developers of Haze, have done better in the past in almost every single way possible, from weapons, to levels, to bot intelligence. Though it was announced just over two years ago, the end result plays like something that was slapped together and shipped after a year or so, rather than something that was painstakingly developed and refined. While there’s nothing about Haze that’s out-and-out broken or completely terrible, it doesn’t come close to meeting the expectations that today’s first-person shooter market creates.</p>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20455/]]></api_detail_url><id>20455</id><name><![CDATA[Haze]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/haze/3030-20455/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-20 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72358/]]></api_detail_url><id>72358</id><name><![CDATA[Haze]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/haze-review/1900-2/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-3/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid 4 is a fitting coda to the series and the single best reason to own a PS3 so far.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is an incredible experience, the best game yet for the PlayStation 3 and a must-see finale to Hideo Kojima’s seminal, often celebrated (and occasionally reviled) stealth action series. But there’s a surprising degree of irony in the success of this last game, which is at its best in ways its predecessors conspicuously fell flat. If you haven’t played a lot of Metal Gear Solid before now, I’m talking about the gameplay here–the part where you grasp a controller and actively make Solid Snake creep around the shadows, stealthily snapping necks and infiltrating enemy bases to stop some nefarious plot or other.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/9726-mgs15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-9726" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/9726-mgs15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-9726"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/9726-mgs15.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Solid Snake returns for one last mission.</figcaption></figure>That part has always been a little lacking. Truthfully, this is a series that you sit back and watch as much as you interact with it. Over the years, MGS has been buoyed by its high production values, well-crafted cinematics, and increasingly twisty, outlandish plots–even as its gameplay has typically lagged behind that of its contemporaries, with nonsensical mechanics and an awkward adherence to tradition making the games less fun to play than they ought to be. Before now, you would have recommended a Metal Gear Solid game to someone looking for a technically impressive and complexly plotted story of intrigue, but not a deeply satisfying action game.</div><br/><div>Given that legacy, what a surprise it was to discover that Guns of the Patriots is not just the most playable game in this franchise but possibly the most graphically intensive and downright thrilling action game ever made. It’s the first game in the series to periodically remove your stealth shackles and actually suggest you plow through your obstacles with guns ablaze, and it does this with seriously explosive aplomb. There are sequences here that come close to fulfilling the promises of Sony’s famously overblown Killzone 2 trailer, in terms of their visual fidelity and the intensity of the action. I honestly had to remind myself more than once I was playing a video game and not a CG movie. If you’re playing this on an HDTV and home theater system, they’ll get a major workout.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/9716-mgs05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-9716" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/9716-mgs05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-9716"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/9716-mgs05.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Metal...Gear?</figcaption></figure>It’s not all explosive shootouts and daring escapes, though. Stealth still rules here, and MGS4 is so much fun to play primarily because it’s finally caught up to modern gameplay conventions, with a controllable camera and over-the-shoulder and first-person aiming modes comparable to those of other great third-person action games. Sure, a few irksome vestiges of the old MGS remain–the rolling and crawling controls are clumsily similar to their forebears, for instance–but finally, it just doesn’t feel like a chore to control Snake.</div><br/><div>Some of the new stealth toys–like the background-mimicking OctoCamo or your little robotic operating buddy the Metal Gear Mk. II–make the sneaking that much more fun to tackle. Then there’s the arsenal of weapons, which has to be the biggest, or at least the most extensible, yet in the series. It’s not enough that you can collect a mountain of assault rifles, submachine guns, pistols, and explosives–you can also slap on laser sights, flashlights, scopes, fore grips, and under-mounted grenade launchers and shotguns. It’s easy to get sucked into the weapons customization, which comes courtesy of a smooth-talking gun dealer named Drebin (who figures into the storyline too).</div><br/><div>As nice as this mammoth arsenal is, it’s even nicer that the game actually encourages you to use all those guns. You can meticulously sneak your way through every scenario if you want, and in fact, there are specific rewards for killing few or no enemies. But in many areas a run-and-gun approach is equally viable and will often let you ally yourself with local militia fighting against Liquid Ocelot’s ubiquitous, nanomachine forces.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/9713-mgs03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-9713" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/9713-mgs03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-9713"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/9713-mgs03.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/9713-mgs03.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Naomi's motives are questionable.</figcaption></figure> If you’ve been keeping up with the series, it won’t surprise you that stopping Ocelot and his plot for world domination after the events of MGS2 is your mission here. It’s not strictly necessary to have played every MGS game before now, but you should at least do some solid research on the previous games’ storylines before playing Guns of the Patriots if you want to pick up on most of the subtle details.</div><br/><div>Plot-wise, the game breaks from tradition in a couple of important ways. For one, it’s not afraid to move the story ahead in time and geography, so you get multiple discrete acts that take place in far-flung locations around the globe. One of these acts offers a great dose of nostalgia for longtime series vets, though discovering what that act is all about is one of the greatest joys in playing the game. The other is the sweeping closure that results from the full disclosure of the series’ many secrets that occurs by the end of the game. If you’ve been wondering about the eventual fates of characters like Raiden, Eva, Vamp, Naomi Hunter, Meryl Silverburgh, and the rapidly aging Snake himself–not to mention the truth about the FoxDie virus, the shadowy Patriots, and the legacy of Big Boss–you’ll get them all gift-wrapped on a platter by the close of the game.</div><br/><div>Anyone who’s played the previous Metal Gear Solid games will already know that to fully appreciate Guns of the Patriots, you must come to grips with Kojima’s unique brand of narrative outlandishness. The cutscenes here are no less frequent, lengthy, or indulgent than before; they’re rife with over-the-top, implausible plot twists, drawn-out exchanges of occasionally stilted dialogue, and character models who, for all their extreme realism, descend into that uncanny valley from time to time. But these scenes excite far more often than they drag. The game is also peppered liberally with Kojima’s trademark little post-modern touches, like references to you the player and the PlayStation 3 hardware, and a smart, quick flashback sequence toward the end that will be especially satisfying for series vets.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/9725-mgs14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-9725" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/9725-mgs14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-9725"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/9725-mgs14.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/9725-mgs14.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Can Liquid be stopped?</figcaption></figure>Kojima Productions saw fit to include an online competitive game aptly called Metal Gear Online. It’s not aggressively bad, but it’s hamstrung by MGS4’s mechanics, which work great when you’re competing against the single-player game’s AI but aren’t really tailored to combat against thinking opponents. MGO’s signup process is also needlessly byzantine, requiring you to create not one but two login IDs just to connect. There’s a good amount of game modes and maps in here, but Konami seems intent on nickel-and-diming MGO players in the future, since you already have to pay extra just for the privilege of creating more than one character profile at a time.</div><br/><div>You could level some other minor complaints at Guns of the Patriots. The game stops to load a little too frequently, and it features not only an initial eight-minute install process but also several subsequent, shorter ones before each act. But none of the game’s minor blemishes are enough to detract from its massive overall impact. It’s the surprising entertainment value of the action, the mind-blowing visuals, and the completeness of the story’s conclusion that make this last installment so satisfying. Metal Gear Solid 4’s positive qualities make it one of the most significant game releases of this generation, and anyone with an appreciation for the evolving form of the medium would do well to play it from start to finish.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20669/]]></api_detail_url><id>20669</id><name><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/3030-20669/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-06-20 12:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72535/]]></api_detail_url><id>72535</id><name><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (Limited Edition)]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Brad]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots-review/1900-3/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-4/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Poker Smash's name might fool you into thinking it's all chips, cards, and bluffing.

It's a high-quality puzzle game that you should look at.</div><div><br /></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11735-psmash2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11735" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11735-psmash2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11735"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11735-psmash2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>You'll need some skill if you want to earn higher combos.</figcaption></figure><br /><br />Rows of blocks with card ranks (10 through Ace) rise up from the bottom of the well, slowly at first. You use the left stick to move your cursor around, and the right stick lets you slide cards left and right. You can use the triggers to speed up or slow down the rising cards, though your slow-motion ability drains out if you use too much of it. You can also drop bombs on cards, causing them to pop and, if you're using them properly, setting up fat chain reactions. Bombs also come in a limited supply.</div><div><br /></div><div>The goal is to make poker hands, starting at three-of-a-kind and moving up to all sorts of straights, flushes, full houses, and so on. The nine flush, which kicks off if you can somehow manage to line up nine cards of the same suit, seems to be the game's most rewarding (and most difficult) prize.</div><div><br /></div><div>The gameplay is broken out a few different ways, including a timed mode, a puzzle mode, and an online mode for up to five people. Online, the dealer button gets passed around amongst the players. When you're the dealer, you can send garbage lines over to your opponents by setting off chain reactions. Also, the online game tries to work in a bankroll, so when you make hands, you gain chips, and you lose chips when other players make hands. It's another neat push-pull concept that changes things up a bit by giving you another way to lose.</div><div><br /></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11734-psmash1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11734" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11734-psmash1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11734"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11734-psmash1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Cards explode out of the pit when you line them up.</figcaption></figure><br /><br />The graphics and sound are OK. The game rotates through music and visual themes in the same way Lumines does, though there are only 11 themes to work through. Also, a lot of the music is pretty hokey. They fit the theme, but every time I listen to the song about poker, I sort of want to just stop playing right there. A custom playlist option lets you cut out themes/songs that annoy you, but you have to unlock the themes first by purchasing them (with in-game earnings) in an online store.</div><div><br /></div><div>So you've probably already skipped over Poker Smash, but double back and check out the demo. It's one of the better 800 point ($10) releases on Xbox Live Arcade.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20681/]]></api_detail_url><id>20681</id><name><![CDATA[Poker Smash]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/poker-smash/3030-20681/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-02-29 12:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-74442/]]></api_detail_url><id>74442</id><name><![CDATA[Poker Smash]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/poker-smash-review/1900-4/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-5/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Bad Company's pro-explosion agenda makes its solo and multiplayer components markedly better than they would be otherwise.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Lots of games have explosions--with all the conflict and war being represented on various video game machines these days, I'd almost be willing to wager that there are more games that have explosions than games that don't. As a result, most standard destruction has become passe. Punching an exploding barrel just doesn't have the same thrill that it once did. That's why someone is always out there, working in secret on games that give explosions the respect they deserve. Sometimes, though, these games focus too much on the explosion, and the gameplay suffers as a result. So it's nice when all this stuff can co-exist. Battlefield: Bad Company has great-looking bangs, but the reason they're so thrilling is because they do more than just damage all nearby players, enemies, and vehicles. These explosions dig big divots in the environment, knock down fences, and blast holes in the sides of buildings, making them an exciting and useful gameplay addition that helps make the whole game better.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11761-images-screenshots-171738-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewONLINE4ww.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11761" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11761-images-screenshots-171738-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewONLINE4ww.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11761"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11761-images-screenshots-171738-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewONLINE4ww.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Love is a battlefield.</figcaption></figure>Bad Company also breaks tradition by being the first Battlefield game with a meaningful single-player mode. Instead of pitting you against bots or partnering you up with flat, uninteresting allies, Bad Company tells a charming story with characters who are fun to have at your side, making the whole thing feel a lot more alive. The story pits you in the role of a soldier as he becomes the fourth member of Bad Company, a tight crew of expendable misfits, brought together because they screwed up somewhere else. As such, you're sent in to do dirty work as a four-man crew against an army of mercenaries and Russians.</div><div><br/></div><div>The mercenaries are where the story strays from the standard war tale and presses firmly into "<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic; ">Three Kings</span> without all the messy political messages" territory. It seems that the mercenaries are part of a private army run by a man known as the Legionnaire, who only conducts business when gold is involved. With truckloads of gold around the region, your team quickly eschews duty, goes AWOL, and gets into the gold hunting business. The game tells most of its story through in-engine cutscenes, where the members of your team really come alive through a combination of clever dialogue, quality voice acting, and terrific visuals.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's also neat that Bad Company manages to feel like a Battlefield game while still presenting you with a cohesive story and multiple objectives. With few exceptions, the game takes place on wide-open battlefields. You'll traverse long distances over the course of the game, which really gives it a sense of size and scope that you don't get from most other shooters. That said, there are limits to this wide-open freedom, as the edges of the current area are closed off. If you travel into these darker areas of the map, a five-second timer pops up, and you're killed (by enemy artillery, the game claims) if you stay outside the lines until time expires. That feels a little artificial, but never comes across like a huge restriction.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11754-163322-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11754" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11754-163322-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11754"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11754-163322-3.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Bad Company is full of homewreckers.</figcaption></figure>That feeling of freedom extends to your tactical options. The game contains a large number of different weapons, which you'll find on dead enemies or laying around in houses. These weapons are technically two weapons, since some of them come with a barrel-mounted grenade launcher, while others arm you with a pistol as a secondary weapon or let you toss grenades. You can also carry a secondary item, which includes a power tool that can fix vehicles, C4 explosives, rocket launchers, laser designators for calling in missile strikes, and so on. The game liberally sprinkles ammo crates across the entire game, giving you plenty of opportunities to blow up anything and everything.</div><div><br/></div><div>And that's what makes Battlefield: Bad Company so much fun. Many sections of the game have you working your way through a bunch of small, enemy-filled houses. While you could crawl through windows or look for doors to make your way from one house to the next, it's way faster and way more fun to just blast holes in walls and leave a path of scorched Earth in your wake. While you can't quite take down an entire building, you can blow most walls and roofs completely apart, denying your enemy cover in the process. The devastation is useful and it also looks fantastic, which is a winning combination.</div><div><br/></div><div>The dynamic destruction of Bad Company also carries over to the multiplayer side. Online, the game becomes a bit more traditional, offering a style of class-based multiplayer with unlockable weapons for each class. While you could argue that playing with preset classes in a post-Call of Duty 4 world is a bit dated, the differences between the classes are meaningful and interesting. Even the support class, which does double duty as both a medic and an engineer, is fun to play, largely because he also gets the ability to call in mortar strikes and wields a light machine gun.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11755-171732-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewMay121ww.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11755" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11755-171732-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewMay121ww.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11755"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11755-171732-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewMay121ww.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11755-171732-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewMay121ww.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The mortar strike lets you use the Russians' technology against them.</figcaption></figure>The multiplayer mode in Bad Company is called Gold Rush, and it's slightly different from the standard Conquest mode that Battlefield is known for. The teams are assigned to attacker and defender roles. The attacking team has to blow up two gold crates that the defending team must fight to protect. The defenders win if they can drain the attacking team's respawn meter. If the attackers get both gold crates, they earn more respawns and push the defenders back to another set of gold crates, and then another. So if the attackers can push the defenders back and destroy all the crates, they win. If the defenders drain their enemy's respawn meter, they win.</div><div><br/></div><div>It makes for an interesting struggle, and the open areas and vehicle-enabled gameplay that you'd expect to find in a Battlefield game is present, though the vehicle control does take some getting used to. There are plenty of houses and other buildings to hide in or blow up, and overall, the maps feel just right for the 24-player limit.</div><div><br/></div><div>As you play online ranked matches, you earn experience points that grant you additional ranks. You also earn unlock points when you gain a rank, which you can use to unlock three more items per class--two primary weapons and one special item, such as a health recharger, mortar strike, anti-tank mines, and so on. There are also ten weapons in multiplayer--two per class--that can't be selected under normal circumstances. One set is the gold set, which are given to players who purchase the Gold Edition version of the game for an extra $10. If you don't get this version, you still earn these weapons when you hit the level cap at rank 25.</div><div><br/></div><div>The other set is a little more insidious, as it requires you to jump through a mess of marketing behavior-oriented hoops. One weapon is earned for pre-ordering the game (so if you're reading this and thinking about buying the game, it's already too late). Another you get for signing up for the Bad Company newsletter. Another is earned for playing the demo version of the game and ranking up to level four. The whole thing feels cheap and filthy, though the good news is that these weapons don't really feel very necessary, either. After unlocking every other weapon, you'll have six primary weapons to choose from. While I wasn't able to unlock all of these guns and see them for myself, the statistics given for their accuracy, handling, rate of fire, and so on don't make them sound like must-have equipment.</div><div><br/></div><div>Between its easy-to-enjoy multiplayer and the romp that is the single-player campaign, Battlefield: Bad Company is an easy game to like. It looks great, has fun characters, a load of interesting weaponry, and works nicely whether you're playing alone or with a squad. The campaign lasts long enough to feel fulfilling, and the multiplayer kept me coming back once that was complete.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20655/]]></api_detail_url><id>20655</id><name><![CDATA[Battlefield: Bad Company]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/battlefield-bad-company/3030-20655/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-07-06 12:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72591/]]></api_detail_url><id>72591</id><name><![CDATA[Battlefield: Bad Company]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/battlefield-bad-company-review/1900-5/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-6/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Lego Indy is an endearing romp through the classic swashbuckling films, but the Lego gameplay's rough edges are starting to show.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p>It's easy to imagine a day when we're all jaded and cynical about the endless number of Lego Your-Franchise-Here titles flooding the market, but I don't think that day is here yet. Traveller's Tales--the developer behind the previous Lego Star Wars games and now Lego Indiana Jones--has figured out a workable formula for simple, kid-friendly cooperative action with light puzzle-solving elements that will remain viable for a good long while. Just add beloved franchise, stir, and serve to a willing readymade audience. To me, the Lego formula is only as entertaining as the franchises you bind to it, but luckily, Star Wars and Indiana Jones are pretty hard to dislike.<br/><br/></p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11815-legoindy08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11815" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11815-legoindy08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11815"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/11815-legoindy08.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Run Indy run!</figcaption></figure>Anyone who's played one of the Lego Star Wars games will know exactly what they're getting into here, since Lego Indy is basically one of those games with different levels and characters slapped on. It represents all three of the original movies (sorry, &lt;i&gt;Crystal Skull&lt;/i&gt;) with six levels each, and every level brings in the relevant story characters to plow through a bunch of enemies, collectables, and some easy environmental puzzles. In between, you can head back to the game's hub, Barnett College, to cash in some of those collectables on cheats and tons more playable characters. It's all standardized Lego action game stuff. No big surprises here.<br/><br/>My problem with Lego Indy isn't that it's the fourth game to get the Lego treatment in three years. It's that there are just too many elements of the gameplay that still feel clumsy and unrefined. On the surface, the game hits the right notes: you've got light-hearted brawling, some decent platforming sequences, and puzzles that don't take a lot of brain power to put together. But there are a lot of irksome aspects in the game's design. The characters' feet get little traction on the ground, so it's easy to slide right into a few pits when running through a platforming area, making you start over repeatedly. Some of the buttons have multiple contextual actions mapped to them, so you occasionally find yourself switching characters when you were trying to get into a vehicle, or hurling away an item you wanted to use instead. You can frequently get stuck in the level geometry. Sometimes your AI-controlled buddy character will disappear somewhere in the level, forcing you to run backwards until you find out where they got hung up and force them to get a move on.<br/><br/>I could go on. None of these little issues are a big deal on their own, but cumulatively they make the gameplay tiresome more often than I would have liked. Traveller's Tales could iron out most of the frustrating little quirks by critically evaluating the gameplay and making a few tweaks here and there. It's probably too late to apply the fixes to the upcoming Lego Batman, but this series needs some refinement if it's going to stay entertaining to discriminating gamers in the long run.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11816-legoindy06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11816" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11816-legoindy06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11816"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/11816-legoindy06.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Mola Ram is displeased.</figcaption></figure>I don't want to sound too down on Lego Indiana Jones. As with all the Lego games, the thing that keeps Indy's gameplay merely a little annoying and not downright maddening is how casual the game really is. That's mainly because you have unlimited lives with no penalty for dying, so you can just button-mash your way through every level without regard for personal safety if you want. Like Star Wars before it, Indy also gets more fun after you finish it the first time through and can go back to each level in "free play" mode, which lets you instantly cycle between a bunch of characters with every ability in the game. That naturally makes it easier to get through most of the obstacles (cutting down on the frustration factor) and allows you to pick up more of the collectables you couldn't get the first time, too. Running through areas in free play with a second player is usually good for a few chuckles.<br/><br/>Lego Indiana Jones has enough entertainment value to make it worth running through, when you're in a casual mood. The series' trademark mirthful animated cutscenes are also in effect here, making the package a bit more endearing. After Lego Batman comes out, though, I hope Traveller's Tales takes a good look at where its Lego games are going and makes the tweaks and additions necessary to keep the franchise relevant.<br/><br/>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20534/]]></api_detail_url><id>20534</id><name><![CDATA[LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/lego-indiana-jones-the-original-adventures/3030-20534/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-07-02 12:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73265/]]></api_detail_url><id>73265</id><name><![CDATA[Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Brad]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/lego-indiana-jones-the-original-adventures-review/1900-6/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-7/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy is a flashy action game that's sabotaged by a brief runtime and a lack of depth.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>As much as I appreciated the way 2002’s The Bourne Identity restored some of the seriousness to international espionage that the James Bond franchise had been frittering away for so many years, anyone who called it a “thinking man’s action movie” was just covering for the fact that they loved watching Matt Damon outrun Parisian cops in a beat-up Mini Cooper and stick pens in dudes’ hands. Robert Ludlum’s The Bourne Conspiracy doesn’t feature any of the actors from the film, instead replacing them with a cast of similarly stern-faced CG models and studio soundalikes, but it ably captures the feel of the first Bourne film, recreating a number of its memorable action set pieces. It can be a viscerally enjoyable experience, though it’s also a fleeting experience that, unlike the movie, offers little reason to come back to it.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/11779-bourne_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11779" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/11779-bourne_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11779"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/11779-bourne_1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The environments are right out of the movie.</figcaption></figure>The Bourne Conspiracy plays out like The Bourne Identity with extended flashback sequences. The game kicks off with government assassin Jason Bourne in Marseilles on his doomed mission to assassinate deposed African dictator Wombosi, which leads into the start of the film, with an amnesiac Bourne getting picked up by a fishing boat in the Mediterrenean. From there, the connections between the events of the film and the flashbacks turn into non-sequiturs–one moment Bourne is looking at a handgun, the next he’s reliving an old Zurich assignment. The Bourne Conspiracy does a bang-up job of recreating and expanding on some of the more memorable scenes from The Bourne Identity, but since the game basically wedges lengthy flashback missions in where there would normally be exposition or character development, the actual narrative kind of gets the short shrift.</div><div><br/></div><div>What The Bourne Conspiracy lacks in coherent, compelling storytelling, though, it makes up for with the kind of calculated brutality that has been a defining characteristic of the Bourne movies. The gameplay generally alternates between a Gears-of-War-style third-person shooter and a simple one-on-one brawler, with loads of interactive cinematic sequences peppered throughout. Many of the best moments in The Bourne Conspiracy come courtesy of the adrenaline meter, which fills as you punch/shoot dudes in the face, and basically allows you to automatically take out an enemy while enjoying a quick brutal cinematic moment. These takedowns can look awesome, with Jason often improvising with objects in the environment or using an enemy’s own weapons against him, though they also start repeating pretty quickly. They also take much of the challenge out of the game–virtually any time there’s too much heat, you can just press B and watch Bourne execute his enemies with extreme prejudice, which is symptomatic of the game’s tendency to take control away from the player during its best moments.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/11782-bourne_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11782" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/11782-bourne_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11782"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/11782-bourne_3.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Despite being short, the action is satisfying.</figcaption></figure>Despite being jam-packed with some pretty spectacular T-rated violence, The Bourne Conspiracy seems to end before it even really gets started, clocking in at a brisk three or four hours. That’s fairly short, to be sure, though I’m not sure that the gameplay could carry the game much further. The gunplay is competent, and the AI can be pretty sneaky at times, but it rarely feels very dangerous. The hand-to-hand combat has bigger problems, in that it consists of a meager number of simple three-hit combos, and a number of the fights drag on for way longer than they ought to.</div><div><br/></div><div>The general lack of depth in The Bourne Conspiracy is made somewhat forgivable by its great-looking visuals, with snappy animations that really help sell a lot of the close-quarters action; nicely detailed environments that are filled with destructible bits; and lots of really sharp elemental effects like fire and rain. It has some problems, too, such as some gritty skin textures, and there’s a persistent problem of textures taking far too long to pop in.</div><div><br/></div><div>The Bourne Conspiracy is a short game that can be clumsy and repetitive at times, but it does it with enough style that I didn’t feel like it was a complete waste of time. For what you get, though, it’s still tough to justify the $60 price tag.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20488/]]></api_detail_url><id>20488</id><name><![CDATA[Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/robert-ludlums-the-bourne-conspiracy/3030-20488/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-07-02 12:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72417/]]></api_detail_url><id>72417</id><name><![CDATA[Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/robert-ludlums-the-bourne-conspiracy-review/1900-7/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-8/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Burnout Paradise takes some risks with some of the series' most basic concepts, and the end result pays off surprisingly well.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Burnout Paradise is an amazing open-world racing game that stays true to the Burnout legacy, but you might not feel that way when you first pop in the disc. For the first several hours, the game comes off as overwhelming, with so many different things being thrown at you that you're not sure what to do first, or what even matters and what's just a bonus extra. Then there's the city. Paradise City, too, feels a little daunting at first blush. But as you play more of it, everything starts falling into place. Once you've got the hang of it and learned the best ways to get into and out of the downtown area, the ways to progress through the game become clear. And there's a lot of progression to be found between the 120 single-player events, the 350 online challenges (though due to repetition, there aren't 350 <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">unique</span> challenges), and the "Road Rules" that give you a time and score to beat on every single road in the game.</div><div><br /></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11827-burnoutp6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11827" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11827-burnoutp6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11827"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11827-burnoutp6.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Take me down to the Paradise City.</figcaption></figure>The offline events give you the same sort of racing and raging events that you'd expect to see from the series, though the open world of Paradise makes things feel quite a bit different. Now, you have to focus on the world, which turns you should take, and if there are any shortcuts along the way to cut your drive time. In events with a set finish line, the game uses a basic navigation system to tell you where to turn. As you complete the events, you'll raise in rank and earn new cars.</div><div><br /></div><div>The online mode feels like a weird social experiment in video game form. That's because the game's online challenges aren't really like anything you've seen before, especially in a driving game. Many of them are basic, like "use boost for 10 seconds" or "catch air for a total of 20 seconds." But some of them have you using your head, trying to figure out which ramp and which approach will let you do a barrel roll through a hoop, or which car park's rooftop ramp will let you jump onto a specific building. This is where the game becomes cooperative, and where communication becomes absolutely key, since some players still don't even know what a challenge is, let alone how to whip a 360-degree flat spin off of a ramp.</div><div><br /></div><div>Other challenges put all of the players (up to eight) in cramped quarters, like an expressway with thin ramps in the middle of it. You're all trying to jump off these tiny ramps, and everyone is colliding all over the place--at the base of the ramp, upon landing, and if you're lucky, in mid-air. The chaos these events add may make your task take a bit longer, but they're also at least half of the fun. Only the extremely impatient among us won't enjoy that aspect of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>All this communication and word-of-mouth information dispensing can get in the way, though. Joining random games rarely nets you a full group of focused, challenge-hungry individuals. And when any player quits the game mid-challenge, the task is failed. Having seven players do something tricky, only to realize that the eighth player is off on the other side of the city, totally oblivious to the action and unwilling to listen to the other players, gets old fast. You may never find enough people to finish all of the eight-player challenges, but with a focused group of friends, busting out the two-, three-, and four-player sets won't be too tricky.</div><div><br /></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11822-burnoutp1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11822" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11822-burnoutp1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11822"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11822-burnoutp1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Where the grass is green.</figcaption></figure>While the manual does briefly describe every aspect of Burnout Paradise, you get the sense that the game is deliberately vague on some topics. Power Parking, for example, scores you based on how well you can fling your car into a parallel parking space at high speed. The game doesn't seem to prompt you to do it beyond a loose hint or two from the DJ. And unless you were to get online and encounter a challenge that required it, you might play through the entire game without ever doing it once or hearing anything about it.</div><div><br /></div><div>The other Road Rule is the Showtime score. Showtime mode replaces the linear, puzzle-like Crash mode from previous Burnout games, and in keeping with the rest of the game's motif, it's more open-ended than its predecessor. Tapping LB and RB (or L1 and R1 on the PS3) slides your car out sideways and makes it start flipping. At this point, everything slows down and you have air control of your car. Your goal is to keep crashing your flaming husk into as many other cars as possible. The boost button lets you pop up off the ground and keep moving, and you'll need to keep hitting cars to keep the boost meter filled. Once you run out of boost and come to a standstill, the game tallies up your Showtime score for that road and play resumes. Leaderboards are also kept for this mode. While it doesn't require you to think hard and dissect each situation like the crash junctions of the past, it's still a wild, great-looking ride that's a great tension reliever.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>If you've played the demo on PS3 or 360, you already know that the game looks great, but the full game gives you a lot more to look at, from more great-looking fictional cars to a variety of locations. All of it comes to you at a smooth frame rate that conveys the same sense of speed that you're used to seeing in a Burnout game. In direct comparison, the textures in the PS3 version appear to be a bit cleaner-looking, and the higher quality of the PlayStation Eye camera means that the photos you send to other players during online events are better on the PS3. The differences between the two feel minor.</div><div><br /></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11828-burnoutp7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11828" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11828-burnoutp7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11828"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11828-burnoutp7.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11828-burnoutp7.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>And the girls are non-existent. Well, really, there are no boys, either. Just cars and faceless radio DJs.</figcaption></figure>The soundtrack and DJ Atomika, who pops in during songs to give you hints and provide some general flavor, aren't nearly as good as the rest of the audio. The DJ, while better than Stryker from Burnout 3, can get awfully grating over time. The music starts on a great note by playing Guns 'n' Roses' "Paradise City" every time you fire up the game. Perfect. The rest of the soundtrack sounds a little limp and, as with most EA Trax productions, it feels like it was put together by a marketing team, not by someone with the game's interests at the front of their mind. At least there's an LCD Soundsystem track in there before it assaults you with the same Avril Lavigne song that "premiered" in Burnout Dominator.</div><div><br /></div><div>There's more opacity here than there probably should be, but once you penetrate its dark shell and figure out what, exactly, is going on, Burnout Paradise is nothing short of amazing. The team at Criterion took a big chance and it's paid off very well. The game revamps the stock formula in major ways without losing most of the high-speed racing flavor that you hope to see from something with Burnout in the title.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-5648/]]></api_detail_url><id>5648</id><name><![CDATA[Burnout Paradise]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/burnout-paradise/3030-5648/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-03-01 12:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-14414/]]></api_detail_url><id>14414</id><name><![CDATA[Burnout Paradise]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/burnout-paradise-review/1900-8/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-9/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Professor Layton and the Curious Village is an outstanding mix of charm and logic that's likely to make a pretty deep impression on you.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>I want to be Professor Layton when I grow up. There, I said it. But there's really no shame in that, because Professor Layton is easily the smartest guy in the world. Or, at least, he is when it comes to brain teasers. His DS game, Professor Layton and the Curious Village, combines a compelling-but-basic point-and-click adventure game with 135 logic puzzles and riddles. The combination of its charming presentation and tricky challenges makes for a terrific end product that fits perfectly onto the DS.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11831-layton_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11831" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5" data-width="250" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11831-layton_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11831"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/11831-layton_1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The top screen gives you the lowdown on what you're trying to accomplish.</figcaption></figure>It'd be easy to forgive Layton for a substandard story line, because the puzzles and challenges are what give the game its lasting value. But the story, which has Layton and his young apprentice Luke scouting around a strange, puzzle-loving town in search of the mysterious treasure of a deceased noble, is great, too. There are just enough twists and turns in the mystery to keep you interested in what will happen next, and even though you may start to suspect where things are going before you reach the conclusion, getting there and seeing it for yourself is definitely worth it.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game's puzzles are jammed into this standard adventure game structure. You'll encounter plenty of different characters on the streets, and more often than not, they'll drop a new puzzle in your lap. Don't they understand that you've got mysteries to solve? While you don't need to complete all of the game's puzzles to finish the game, you'll occasionally encounter roadblocks in the story that prevent you from moving forward until you've completed a specific number of puzzles. The puzzles are almost never related to what you're actually trying to accomplish in your investigation, so you may occasionally wonder why these goons are getting in your way with some mind-bender about wolves, sheep, and a raft when you're trying to get to the bottom of a murder. Layton, being the type of gentleman that I can only hope to become someday, patiently solves these puzzles, as opposed to open-hand-slapping them while shouting obscure early-90s rap slang.</div><div><br/></div><div>If you've ever encountered a book of brain teasers, many of the puzzles in Curious Village will seem pretty familiar. Old standbys, like reorganizing matchsticks to change one picture into another, or Die-Hard-3-style liquid pouring challenges, or trying to place queens on a chessboard in such a way where no queen can attack any other queen are all present and accounted for.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11832-layton_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11832" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5" data-width="272" style="width: 272px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11832-layton_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11832"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/11832-layton_2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>You might be able to do this in 12 moves, but you can take a lot longer if you like.</figcaption></figure>While the puzzles at the front of the game are a bit easier than the ones you'll face near the end, the challenge comes from within. Even if you think you're reading things closely, you'll probably get tripped up here and there. If you do get stuck, the game offers three levels of hints for each puzzle, though you'll have to spend a hint coin each time you want to see one. Hint coins are hidden around the town, and you can usually find more by tapping garbage cans, doors, and other out-of-place objects. While the three levels of hints are supposed to become more and more helpful as you burn through them, one of the more frustrating moments in Professor Layton comes when you've seen all three hints for a puzzle and <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic; ">still</span> have trouble figuring out the answer. But with a healthy helping of perseverance, most players should be able to complete enough tasks to see the game's ending without resorting to a FAQ. Once you've exhausted the main game's puzzles, you can go on to try a series of harder bonus puzzles that unlock as you complete certain in-game tasks. Or you can get online, as the developers are offering up one new downloadable puzzle every week. The downloadable puzzles are of roughly the same quality as the ones found in the main game, but when you remove the puzzles from the adventure, they aren't quite as meaningful.</div><div><br/></div><div>All this adventuring and puzzling is wrapped up in a neat audiovisual package that ties it all together. You'll get full-motion video for the bigger story sequences, complete with some great character voices. Outside of that, though, the hand-drawn still images for characters and backgrounds look great and give the whole game a very warm feeling.</div><div><br/></div><div>That's not a trait that one would commonly associate with a puzzle-based game that, when you break it down, probably has more in common with Nintendo's long list of brain training games than anything else. But that warmness is something that really sums up the entire experience. Professor Layton and the Curious Village has a certain warmth to it that makes it easy to love, even when you're up against a particularly annoying puzzle. Personally, I found this first adventure so strong that I'm already getting antsy just thinking about the next game in this planned trilogy.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-11865/]]></api_detail_url><id>11865</id><name><![CDATA[Professor Layton and the Curious Village]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/professor-layton-and-the-curious-village/3030-11865/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-03-07 10:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-30207/]]></api_detail_url><id>30207</id><name><![CDATA[Professor Layton and the Curious Village]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/professor-layton-and-the-curious-village-review/1900-9/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Nintendo DS]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-10/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Smash Bros. Brawl is probably at its best when enjoyed by a group of four friends, but solo players with an eye for Nintendo nostalgia aren't totally left out.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a game that's practically impossible to hate if you've been playing games for a serious length of time, unless you're the sort of jerk who automatically hates anything that's popular. But how much will you like it? That's a much more difficult question to answer.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11945-smashbrawl_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11945" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.82291666666667" data-width="192" style="width: 192px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:82.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11945-smashbrawl_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11945"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/11945-smashbrawl_01.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Sleepy time!</figcaption></figure>Like the previous games in the series, Brawl takes a basic four-player fighting game and applies the accessibility of a typical party game. Though it's a little more nuanced in spots and feels like the characters who were overpowered in the previous game are a little more balanced in this outing, it'll be hard for any but the most die-hard Smash Bros. fans to notice a meaningful difference. If you're just getting started and have no idea what the series is all about, it'll probably take you around 30 minutes to pick up the basics and understand why, exactly, you don't want to fall off the edges of the game's numerous backgrounds. After another hour or so, you'll figure out how to prevent yourself from falling to your death over and over again.</div><div><br/></div><div>The time you spend getting familiar with the game isn't spent figuring out the controls. All of the moves are easy to pull off, even though there are more moves in the game than you might initially suspect. Getting used to the game, whether you're new to the series or just haven't played it in a long time, is more about training yourself to keep up with the action. Smash Bros. is an extremely chaotic game, especially with four players going at once. It can be difficult to follow the action.</div><div><br/></div><div>However, that chaos is one of the best things about the series. The gameplay is at its best when you're sitting next to three friends, manically pounding on buttons and shouting at the top of your lungs. At some point, taking a break to order and eat pizza should be involved. It's a game that gets better as you and your crew get more rambunctious, which is why so many people think it's just for kids. It's also why the game's online multiplayer isn't of much use. While it's technically functional, playing in the cold world of Nintendo's online service completely misses the point of the whole game. With no voice chat, there's no way to yell at your friends. But even voice chat wouldn't properly duplicate the experience of playing with your friends. You'll need a posse of people who are just as excited about Smash Bros. as you are if you want to get the most out of the gameplay.</div><div><br/></div><div>That doesn't mean, however, that there's nothing for you if you don't know anyone else who cares about this release. To use myself as an example, I don't know one other person who genuinely cares about the series. So my multiplayer experiences haven't been the rowdy, curse-filled adventures that seem like this game's stock in trade. Instead, they've consisted of me telling people how to play, we play for 10 minutes or so, shrugs are sent my way, and we go do something else. Yet, in spite of that, I've still managed to have a really good time with the single-player modes, because they still tap into the other big thing about the Smash Bros. series.</div><div><br/></div><div>This game is absolutely infested with nostalgic minutiae from Nintendo's past. It's starts with the selection of playable characters, which includes plenty of obvious choices like Mario, Link, Samus, Kirby, Fox McCloud, Luigi, and Pikachu. Pit from Kid Icarus also makes an appearance, and he's a great new addition. Not every character is a great nostalgic fit, though. It's sort of hard to get excited about Ness or Lucas, both from the Mother series that hasn't been seen in the US since the SNES days. But Brawl takes things a step further than the standard Nintendoverse with the inclusion of Konami's Solid Snake and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. They fit right into the fan-fiction-friendly nature of the game.</div><div><br/></div><div>But the playable characters are just the beginning. Almost every background stage in the game comes from another game, ranging from the standard Mario- and Link-themed levels to areas ones based on WarioWare, Metal Gear, Sonic, Pokemon, and so on. Some areas are straightforward, while others have specific gimmicks to them. The PictoChat level is crazy, because new things are constantly being drawn onto the level, and you can jump around, avoid, or be damaged by most of them. The WarioWare stage occasionally breaks out into a little WarioWare-like microgame, which you must try to complete while still fighting. This just adds to the overall chaos and makes the whole thing even crazier.</div><div><br/></div><div>Then there are assist characters, which are items you can grab and use in battle that unleash even more obscure characters from gaming's past. Plus there are trophies and stickers to be found, many of which also reference a ton of semi-obscure Nintendo stuff, up to and including the instructor from Pilotwings. If you've played a lot of games over the years, you'll really appreciate the game's insane level of detail when it comes to reminding you of games you haven't thought about in a very long time.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11947-smashbrawl_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11947" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11947-smashbrawl_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11947"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11947-smashbrawl_03.jpg"/></a><figcaption>It's a non-stop nostalgia-fest and you're invited!</figcaption></figure>Aside from the standard fighting, Brawl also has an adventure mode, known as The Subspace Emissary, and this is where most of that nostalgic stuff comes alive. The gameplay here is a little funky in spots, because it tries to take the wild-and-loose action of the fighting and applying it to a side-scroller. That makes it frustrating in some spots. But it's worth seeing because it's full of crazy cutscenes that mash the different characters together in ways that rarely make sense. It's pretty cool, seeing Pit, Link, Mario, Yoshi, and Kirby come together to fend off a shared threat. Meanwhile, the Pokemon Trainer (who they should have just named Ash) and Lucas are running around some ruins, all while nefarious guys like Wario, Bowser, and King Dedede are running around blazing fools with a beam cannon that turns living characters into figurines. On top of all that, R.O.B. the Robot pops up in a role that will shock and surprise you. OK, well, maybe it isn't all that shocking, he's just a robot, what does a robot know of good or evil? In lieu of finding a good group of people to play multiplayer with, this ended up being my favorite part of the entire game.</div><div><br/></div><div>So the questions you need to ask yourself before deciding to invest in Super Smash Bros. Brawl concern your own personal level of love for Nintendo's rich history and your ability to rustle up enough enthusiastic locals to get into the multiplayer. If both of those are in your favor, then this is definitely a game you'll want to add to your collection. But if you aren't big in either department, you probably won't understand what all the fuss is about in the first place.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20588/]]></api_detail_url><id>20588</id><name><![CDATA[Super Smash Bros.

But the action is a bit too repetitive to keep you excited for a substantial length of time.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>We're not there yet, but we're getting closer and closer to the point where we can expect that every game that can have some form of online co-operative play will actually have it. Stuff like Gears of War and Halo 3 have put this style of play onto the mainstream map, and the people want more. Rightfully so, I think, considering that running with a pack of AI-controlled goons still doesn't come close to the experience of having actual people at the controls. That's certainly the case with EA's Army of Two, which takes the co-op style of Gears of War, slaps on some tactics, and slides it all into a modern military setting. But even with another player, the action gets repetitive too quickly.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11764-aot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11764" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11764-aot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11764"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11764-aot2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>When not shooting people, these bros just generally like to bro out.</figcaption></figure>The game's story spans over a decade, and stays attached to your two man team of Rios, the conspiracy theorist, and Salem, the somewhat-cocky guy who says "bro" every 15 seconds, bro. You start out taking them through Army Ranger training and one mission for the Army in Somalia. After that, the duo decides to follow their commanding officer into joining up with a private military corporation called SSC. As mercenaries, they'll get sent into hotspots with lots of guns and big, dopey-looking metallic masks that make them look like Knights of the Round Table. But those knights didn't run around with Steyr Augs, P90s, miniguns, or sniper rifles. The game's plot is just deep enough to keep the story moving, but don't expect anything too epic. You'll probably see where the story is going about three levels before it gets there, but it's still a bit of fun to watch it all unfold.</div><div><br/></div><div>For the most part, Army of Two is a standard third-person shooter. Targets are everywhere, and they like to hide behind cover, something you'll also need to do in order to survive. The cover mechanics feel very natural and work well--you don't need to fumble around with buttons in order to stick to walls or pop out to fire a few rounds. It's a good thing you have a partner, too, because the game is filled with very contrived moments where you need two people to proceed, like spots where you'll have to give your partner a boost, and a ton of doors that require two buttons to be pressed simultaneously in order to open. So all of these terrorists you're killing must have to run in groups of at least two, or else they'd get stuck every ten minutes.</div><div><br/></div><div>Aside from the world's dumbest door design, the way Army of Two differentiates itself is with a big meter at the top of the screen that shows you how much "aggro" you or your partner currently have. If you've played a lot of massively-multiplayer online RPGs, you're familiar with the concept of aggro, and it's interesting to see it used in an action game. Long story short, the enemies aim at the character that is perceived as a larger threat. This means you earn aggro when you fire your weapon, and you earn more if you have a larger or louder weapon. The bro that doesn't have any aggro becomes practically invisible, letting that guy run around behind gun emplacements or armored enemies to get a better shot. And this concept makes up the entire game. If you're playing alone, it gets old fast, because all you're ever doing is telling your AI buddy to hide behind something and start shooting. Then you just wait for the meter to swing his way, run around behind everyone, and put them all down from relative safety. You can play through three difficulty settings, though this just makes the enemies better shots, forcing you to adhere to the aggro strategy more rigidly.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11766-aot4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11766" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11766-aot4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11766"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11766-aot4.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The bros make "the beast with two fronts" when surrounded.</figcaption></figure>Playing with another human is more exciting, though the same basic technique still applies. The main difference is that another human will be able to act more intelligently when it comes to saving you. If you're shot up too much, you'll go down and require medical aid from your bro. When you're down, you can sit up and fire your weapon, but can't move. Your partner can drag you around before healing you, letting him drag you out of the line of fire for safe healing. The AI partner doesn't always seem clear on the concept, and he'll often try to heal you in the line of fire, or get your body caught on a piece of cover when trying to drag you and generally behave poorly.</div><div><br/></div><div>That's why it's better to play with another player, but Army of Two doesn't make that as easy as it should. While you can opt to switch back to a single-player game if an online partner quits, you can't have that player jump into the middle of your game--you need to start playing with a player from the beginning of one of the game's six levels. The other issue is that the game feels pretty short, and you're meant to get your replay value out of it by completing those missions again and again. They aren't bad, but once you've learned them by playing each one once or twice, you can just burn through them again and again. The benefit to doing this is earning more money, which you can use to purchase and upgrade your weapons.</div><div><br/></div><div>The weapon upgrade system in Army of Two is probably the best thing about the entire game. You can spend your blood money at mid-mission checkpoints. The upgrades are deeper than most games, letting you get longer barrels for more damaging shots, better stocks and grips for more accuracy, silencers for quiet killing, and so on. In addition to having an impact on a weapon's magazine size, accuracy, and damage, each upgrade also has an effect on how much aggro it will draw. Big shield attachments, longer barrels, and bigger clips make you attract more attention from the enemy. Silencers make you a bit easier to ignore. But if you're trying to get the enemy's attention so your partner can do the dirty work, you can also buy a "pimped" version of your weapon, which bedazzles your gun in gaudy silver, gold, or diamonds. While I could go the rest of my life without hearing about a physical item getting pimped (sorry, Xzibit), it works reasonably well in this context because the rest of the dialogue is similarly dumb... but it's a dumb that you can believe in.</div><div><br/></div><div>There's one great aside where Salem starts mindlessly talking about the members of the Wu-Tang Clan that would have been a much better tone for the entire game, bro, but there's really nothing else like that throughout the game, making this light moment between the duo feel way out of place. The voices fit the characters just fine. The line reads, though, get really stiff in spots. And again, if there's a year-end award for the most brosephed-out game for broheims who like to say "bro," Army of Two will almost certainly take the prize.</div><div><br/></div><div>On top of the campaign, there's a full multiplayer mode that lets teams of two compete in a couple of different games, like warzone, which gives you a map and drops random objectives onto it. The team that completes the objective gets paid for the job, and the team with the most money at the end wins. It's an interesting idea, but I couldn't get into it at all. Melee attacks feel like they're more useful than your guns, since they'll knock you down and give your enemy plenty of time to fill you full of holes while you're helpless on the ground. And the weapon firing in close quarters feels clumsy, which just contributes to the melee madness.</div><div><br/></div><div>While there's a contingent of players out there who will immediately jump at the chance to play another co-op-focused shooter, the lack of tactical variety and short campaign makes Army of Two too repetitive. It has its moments, and it's an OK game overall, though you'll probably be left with the feeling that it could have been a lot better. But then, that's what sequels are for, right bro?</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20479/]]></api_detail_url><id>20479</id><name><![CDATA[Army of Two]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/army-of-two/3030-20479/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-03-16 20:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72397/]]></api_detail_url><id>72397</id><name><![CDATA[Army of Two]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/army-of-two-review/1900-11/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-12/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Rocketmen: Axis of Evil's co-op gives it potential, but the game doesn't move fast enough to deliver any lasting excitement.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Rocketmen: Axis of Evil takes the classic dual joystick shooter formula founded by games like Robotron: 2084 and repopularized by games like Geometry Wars and gives it some superficial RPG elements. Its best feature is that it allows for four-player co-op, locally or online. But the game itself isn't much fun, regardless of the number of players. With its plodding, monotonous pace and scattered presentation, Rocketmen doesn't do enough to separate itself from the seemingly infinite number of other dual joystick shooters available via Xbox Live Arcade or the PlayStation Network.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11958-rocketmen_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11958" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11958-rocketmen_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11958"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11958-rocketmen_3.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The story is told through comic-style panels.</figcaption></figure>The game goes for a retro-futuristic vibe, and it often feels a bit like some old radio play brought to life in video game form, with some occasional humor thrown in for good measure. The story, which is told through comic-book-like panels that move a bit too much for their own good, pits the good guys (Earth), against an evil empire of martians and terrans--which if I'm not mistaken, also refers to Earth. The whole thing comes from some sort of kid-friendly table-top strategy game, which I had never encountered before I sat down to write this review. So I can't really tell you if fans of the cards-and-plastic-ships game will be into this at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>But I <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic; ">can</span> tell you that the gameplay starts out fairly standard, and the first level was decent enough to make me feel OK about investing in the full game. But after that, the game's rough spots really start to show. For one, your default weapon is complete trash. Later on in the game, even the basic enemies seem to take 20 hits to kill with your default piece. Of course, you can pick up additional weapons, and they'll usually clean house, but they don't last very long, even if you upgrade them. You also have an arsenal of secondary weapons at your disposal, but beyond the standard dumb-fire rocket, most of these never felt very necessary. Your movement speed is also really sluggish compared to the bullet speed, making it a little more difficult to dodge shots than it is in other, similar games.</div><div><br/></div><div>The weird thing is that most of these problems are things you'd expect would go away as you upgrade your character. You can pump up your weapons, buy armor, and use your experience points to jack up your character's stats in a handful of categories like life, speed, and damage. But even with these stats raised to their maximum, you never feel especially tough. It doesn't help that you fight the same handful of enemies throughout the entire game, yet as you go from level to level, those same, bland enemies somehow take more shots to kill.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11955-rocketmen_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11955" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11955-rocketmen_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11955"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11955-rocketmen_1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The left joystick is used to move around. The right? Take a wild guess.</figcaption></figure>Rocketmen has ten levels, and you can tackle them alone or as a group. You'll see the story sequences in multiplayer, so this is a perfectly viable way to play on your first run-through. The game doesn't feel like it scales the difficulty much when you're playing with others, though, so if you want to raise your character's levels quickly, you'll probably want to do it by yourself.</div><div><br/></div><div>Not that it matters too much if you die. When you run out of health, you fall to the ground, lose ten percent of the experience points you've collected in that level, and respawn, good as new.</div><div><br/></div><div>I have a deep, weird thing for dual joystick shooters that goes all the way back to Robotron. I'll obsess over the good ones, and I'll give the bad ones more of a shot than they probably deserve. But aside from offering co-op, some occasionally-clever dialogue, and the generic, Diablo-like thrill that I get from any game that lets you build up your character, Rocketmen: Axis of Evil doesn't have much going for it.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20570/]]></api_detail_url><id>20570</id><name><![CDATA[Rocketmen: Axis of Evil]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/rocketmen-axis-of-evil/3030-20570/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-03-22 10:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72582/]]></api_detail_url><id>72582</id><name><![CDATA[Rocketmen: Axis of Evil]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/rocketmen-axis-of-evil-review/1900-12/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store, PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-13/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Even a bundle of technical issues can't stop Bully: Scholarship Edition from letting you have a great time running amok on the Xbox 360]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>It's rare for a game publisher to have an immediately identifiable style, but there's no mistaking Bully for anything other than a Rockstar game. The mechanical comparisons to Grand Theft Auto are fairly apt, though the tone isn't quite as nasty, and your transgressions not as deplorable--if Grand Theft Auto were a felony, Bully would be a misdemeanor. Like GTA, Bully is an engrossing experience that showcases what Rockstar does best: create an evocative caricature of the real world with dark wit, then put you in the role of a thuggish anti-hero who's unafraid of trouble. There's something thoroughly satisfying about getting to play out your prankish schoolboy fantasies, though it's the game's excellence that makes the technical shortcomings specific to Bully: Scholarship Edition on the Xbox 360 so heartbreaking.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11969-360_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11969" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11969-360_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11969"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11969-360_06.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Don't let this jerk push you around.</figcaption></figure>Bully takes place primarily at Bullworth Academy, which unmistakably evokes the brick-and-ivy feel of an upscale private New England school. Just beneath its picturesque surface, though, seethes a merciless clique system that has everyone bullying whomever they can. The faculty is no better than the students, consisting of perverts, drunks, bullies, and corrupt megalomaniacs. You get dropped into the middle of this ruthless sociopolitical microcosm as 15-year-old Jimmy Hopkins, a freckled fireplug of a kid who has a keen disrespect for authority, as well as a general distaste for being bullied. Based on his propensity for violence, as well as the ease with which other characters are able to lead him into doing their bidding for them, Jimmy could easily be a descendant of Vice City protagonist Tommy Vercetti. While Tommy favored automatic weapons and vehicular manslaughter, Jimmy tends to trade in schoolyard brawls and slingshots.</div><div><br/></div><div>Though the story ostensibly revolves around your dealings with a conniving classmate named Gary, a medicated sociopath with designs on running the whole school, you'll spend most of your time infiltrating and overthrowing the various cliques at Bullworth, one at a time. As grim as the setting and story might sound, Bully manages to maintain a cheeky sense of humor throughout, often evoking the slobs-versus-snobs tone of an 80s teen comedy. You'll leave a flaming surprise in front of the door of the teacher's lounge on Halloween, egg the rich kid's house, go on a late-night panty raid in the girl's dorm, sabotage the big football game, and eventually become the big man on campus. The storytelling itself can be a little clunky at times--you have virtually no contact with your nemesis for most of the game, and certain subplots are abruptly left to whither and die--but the tone is much more consistent.</div><div><br/></div><div>Part of what really sets Bully apart from your typical open-world game is the greater sense of structure inherent to going to school. You've got classes twice a day, which play out as thematically appropriate minigames that can be fun, and which confer various bonuses when completed successfully. Of course, juvenile delinquent that you are, you can also choose to skip class, though if you do you'll have to keep a keen eye out for school prefects and other authority figures keen on dragging you back to class. The same goes for if you're caught outside your dorm after curfew. Unlike the apparently meth-addicted GTA protagonists for whom day and night are a single, uninterrupted blur, Jimmy needs a good six hours of sleep a night, and if he's not in a bed by 2AM, he'll pass out on the spot. While all this might sound restrictive, it's loose enough that you have plenty of time to take on missions and get up to all types of no good.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11970-360_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11970" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11970-360_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11970"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11970-360_07.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Jocks.</figcaption></figure>You do plenty of scrapping in Bully, though what's most interesting about the combat is the way it's influenced by your current social standing. The cliques in Bully are much like the gangs in GTA--taking on missions for one clique will invariably affect your standing with another, which will affect how aggressive certain students are towards you. Jimmy's good with his fists and can handle most one-on-one brawls with ease, though if you get overwhelmed it's not hard to run away, hide in a trash can, or duck into a nearby locker. You can use diplomacy and bribes to keep antagonistic students and prefects off your case, and this same system allows you to court the ladies (and a few of the fellas) around campus, plying them with chocolates and flowers for a quick, health-replenishing make-out session.</div><div><br/></div><div>As you progress through the story, you'll start to explore the nearby city of Bullworth, which provides a cutting portrayal of a sleepy little town stratified by class, and you'll also gain access to a skateboard, and later on, a bike that make travel easier. A well-realized open world is only really meaningful if there's lots of fun stuff to do, and in this regard, Bully is a veritable playground of mischief. A quick look at the in-game stats screen gives you a good sense of what you can do, including, but not limited to, starting food fights, egging cars, throwing firecrackers into toilets, giving wedgies, competing in go-kart and bike races, hitting people with stink bombs, water balloons, and itching powder, take on a paper route, mowing lawns, shoveling snow, entering boxing matches, taking photos for the school yearbook, spraying graffiti, breaking into lockers, playing arcade games, and more. The individual activities aren't always terribly engaging on their own, but the sheer volume more than makes up for it.</div><div><br/></div><div>Bully: Scholarship Edition sports a few new bells and whistles not found in the original PlayStation 2 version, including eight new missions, four new classes, and four new characters. Based on the few hours of Bully that I played when it originally hit the PS2, their impact on the single-player game seem subtle. There are also a handful of two-player minigames that have been adapted from some of the carnival and classroom minigames found in the single-player game, but without the greater context they're forgettable. The visual fidelity of Bully has been improved considerably in bringing it to the 360, with cleaner textures, better lighting, and HD support, though it's still blocky enough that you can tell this is a slightly gussied up PS2 game. The music is absolutely fantastic, with an overall sound that I can only describe as sounding like a 1960s spy movie scored by Danny Elfman, before he completely ran out of ideas. I rarely care for video game soundtracks outside the context of the game, but the music in Bully is just so unique and catchy that it's still compelling entirely on its own.</div><div><br/></div><div>Sadly, a good deal of the goodwill that Bully: Scholarship Edition rightfully deserves is undercut by persistent frame-rate issues, long load times, weird draw-distance issues, and a general instability that caused the game to lock up a good half-dozen times on me. Rockstar has since released a downloadable update for the game that purports to address this stuff, though on the two relatively new Xbox 360s that I've tested the game on, it actually makes things worse, adding flickery textures and skipping audio to the existing problems. I've heard scattered anecdotes claiming that the patch does in fact smooth out the game's technical wrinkles for some people, so it might be a bit of a crap shoot as to whether the patch will do anything for you or not.</div><div><br/></div><div>As much of a bummer as the bugginess of Bully: Scholarship Edition for the Xbox 360 is, the underlying game is still extremely well-crafted, and I was happy to sink a good 20 hours into the game, though a good portion of that time was admittedly spent chasing after achievement points. Whether you'll want to do the same will hinge on your tolerance for technical issues, and your desire to act out your misanthropic high-school fantasies.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-5092/]]></api_detail_url><id>5092</id><name><![CDATA[Bully: Scholarship Edition]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/bully-scholarship-edition/3030-5092/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-03-26 13:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-13054/]]></api_detail_url><id>13054</id><name><![CDATA[Bully]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/bully-scholarship-edition-review/1900-13/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-14/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Vegas 2 doesn't make huge changes to what you saw in the previous game, and the story can be hard to follow, but the action is as explosive as ever.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>With a campaign that's more of a different take on the first game's story than an actual follow-up, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 feels more like a mission pack with minor corrections than a full-fledged sequel. While that will probably leave some players feeling disappointed, the tactical action formula still works just fine, resulting in an occasionally clunky but still solid tactical shooter.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11978-r6vegas2_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11978" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11978-r6vegas2_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11978"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11978-r6vegas2_4.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Hiding behind stuff is a good way to live longer.</figcaption></figure>The gameplay consists of the same sort of tactical shooting action that was found in the first game. You roll from checkpoint to checkpoint, taking cover behind objects and telling your AI-controlled dudes to bust through doors and gun down people for you. You'll occasionally encounter a hostage situation, which requires you to be a bit more careful with your fire. But the game doesn't rely too heavily on the tactical aspects of play, letting you solve most of your problems by shooting quickly and accurately. That's not to say the game is especially easy, though. It requires a lot of patience, because if you go charging around, you'll get laid down pretty quickly. Instead, you need to think about your squadmates, consider what's behind every door, and act accordingly.</div><div><br/></div><div>A lot of that slow play is removed by the game's two-player co-op mode. While the game tells more of the story in co-op mode this time around, it's still a very different experience. When a player goes down, he respawns in ten seconds, provided the other human player doesn't get dropped during that time. Weirdly enough, the two AI squadmates are also present, and only the host can control them. This makes the second player feel disconnected from the action because he has no real tactical involvement--he's just a shooter. He's also weirdly silent--even though the second player can tag enemies while using the snake cam, there's no dialogue to say "hit him first" or "he's priority two" or anything like that.</div><div><br/></div><div>The respawn feature makes the game way easier, as you can just run through blasting guys without any real care as to whether or not you stay alive. Depending on your personal enjoyment of stealthy tactics, this can either dumb the game down a bit too far or make things way more exciting. As long as the other player knows to back off when you go down, everything is fine. Making matters weirder, your AI squadmates still have to be manually revived. Seems like making the human players revivable the same way the AI guys are would make more sense and help maintain some sense of discipline, but then again, I had a lot more fun just running around blasting dudes without having to worry about a serious death penalty.</div><div><br/></div><div>Regardless of how you play it, the story mode is tough to follow, especially if you didn't finish the previous Rainbow Six Vegas game or don't pay attention during the first mission. The game opens with a five-year-old flashback, then fast-forwards to the same timeline as the previous game, with most of the game running concurrently to the first Vegas. When I reached the end of the game--a dopey encounter that didn't feel as smooth as the rest of the opposition--I had no idea who this guy was standing in front of me, or why he was giving me some long speech about why he turned out so evil.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11983-r6vegas2_9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11983" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11983-r6vegas2_9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11983"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11983-r6vegas2_9.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Ordering your team around and letting them take the shots is another way to stay safe.</figcaption></figure>With the difficult-to-follow story, it's a good thing that the shooting itself is so much fun. Popping in and out of cover is easy and handled very well, making it more about lining up your shots and putting bullets into terrorists, rather than fumbling around with cover. Ordering your team around is really easy, too, with plenty of context-sensitive moments for getting them to use ropes, stack up on doors, and so on. There's a real sense of satisfaction that comes from breaching rooms and taking out the opposition before they can even figure out what's going on.</div><div><br/></div><div>That said, it'll take new players a little while to get used to all of the controls, especially because some buttons have multiple functions depending on if you press and release a button or hold it down. Plus, if you've been playing copious amounts of Call of Duty 4, expect to toss at least one inadvertent grenade at your feet when trying to duck. I learned that the hard way.</div><div><br/></div><div>Beyond the campaign mode, there's also a terrorist hunt mode, where you, either with your AI teammates or up to three human players, fight off a posse of terrorists in the game's multiplayer levels. You're stuck with limited respawns, forcing you to be pretty careful. There's also a full-on online mode for up to 14 players on the PS3, and 16 on the Xbox 360. You'll find the typical assortment of objective-based modes, as well as deathmatch options. The 360 version has a ranked game option that locks down the options to limit respawns. Unranked games on 360 and all games on the PS3 give you plenty of options to play around with, including the ability to limit what weapons players can use, should you decide that the game's auto-shotgun is way out of control and overpowered.</div><div><br/></div><div>The adversarial multiplayer is awesome when you're playing with a group of similarly-skilled players, and the game's maps offer enough variety to keep you interested for a good amount of time. The cover mechanics don't always work quite as well when playing against humans, since any exposed body part will immediately get hit by a skilled player, but this just forces you to be more careful when taking on real people.</div><div><br/></div><div>Vegas 2 puts a fat COD4-like experience bar at the bottom of the screen as you play, regardless of mode. This works just as well here as it did in Infinity Ward's shooter, giving you a clear sense of progression as you play. Ranking up unlocks weapons, armor, and new clothing for your character. A new system called A.C.E.S. gives you more ways to level up by tracking your progress in three categories: marksmanship, close-quarters battle, and assault. When you eliminate enemies in a way that falls into one of these three buckets--such as getting headshots, killing enemies from behind, or using grenades--you'll earn points in that category. When you earn enough points in a category, it will level up and you'll either get a big bonus for your main experience points counter, or you'll unlock an additional weapon. These simple goals make it very easy for Vegas 2 to sink its hooks into you and get addictive. It's also great that every game type, from the campaign mode to unranked online matches, all feed into the same pool of XP. So you'll always feel like you're progressing.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11985-r6vegas2_11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11985" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11985-r6vegas2_11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11985"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11985-r6vegas2_11.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11985-r6vegas2_11.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>If you've ever wanted to run around Las Vegas with a gun, now's your chance.</figcaption></figure>The differences between the 360 and PS3 versions of Vegas 2 feel pretty minor. Both let you use the camera to map your face onto your character, both control just as well, and both have the same achievement set--though, obviously, only the 360 version will contribute to an overall score, the PS3's set of ribbons and awards are entirely self-contained. The PS3 version of the game also opens with a mandatory install process that places around 2.5GB of data onto your hard drive. If you're the sort of person who gets all up in arms over installing console games, this will be the sort of thing that gets you all up in arms.</div><div><br/></div><div>There have been a lot of reports about the PS3 version having serious online problems, but I didn't encounter anything too game-breaking in either version. The game doesn't respond especially well to lag, making the action jumpy and unplayable if the player running the server doesn't have enough bandwidth. There seem to be a few sound bugs in both versions as well. Online, I ran into cases in both versions where some effect would seem to get stuck, resulting in endless looping gunfire. Offline, I also ran into cases where bullets that were fired nearby would sound more muffled than they should, or spots where my weapon, or the guns being held by my teammates, stopped making noise entirely. I noticed a bit more of that on the 360 version than on the PS3. So the game is sloppy in a few spots, but overall, it never felt like a huge deal.</div><div><br/></div><div>I ended up enjoying Rainbow Six Vegas 2 a lot more than the first game, even though they're pretty similar overall. The online options really give you a healthy amount of things to see and do, and the XP and A.C.E.S. systems constantly egg you on every time you get a headshot or kill someone at range. If you played the first game to death and are absolutely ready for more, Vegas 2 is right up your alley, but all those similarities mean that you'll probably burn out on this one a bit faster.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-1986/]]></api_detail_url><id>1986</id><name><![CDATA[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas-2/3030-1986/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-03-27 13:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72913/]]></api_detail_url><id>72913</id><name><![CDATA[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas-2-review/1900-14/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-15/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Condemned 2: Bloodshot is the video-game equivalent of blunt-force trauma.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Bowling pins. Toilet seats. Drive shafts. Deer antlers. These are just a few of the makeshift weapons that you will beat your deranged, uncontrollably violent opponents to death with in Condemned 2: Bloodshot. This first-person action adventure game is far and away the most unflinchingly sadistic and gruesome video game I've ever played, outclassing its predecessor in virtually every way possible. This is a game that puts faint hearts and weak stomachs through a battery of tests, but if you're up for it, Condemned 2 is thoroughly and brutally entertaining.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11988-ss_condemned2_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11988" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11988-ss_condemned2_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11988"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11988-ss_condemned2_01.jpg"/></a><figcaption>You can tell by the way this guy's head is a skull that he means business.</figcaption></figure>Special agent Ethan Thomas, the two-fisted protagonist from Condemned: Criminal Origins, is in bad shape after the events of the first game. Having quit SCU, the law enforcement agency he was previously working for, Ethan now spends his time drinking in dodgy bars, hiding from the creeping darkness and twisted hallucinations that haunt his every waking moment. However, it would seem that the case from Criminal Origins still has some loose ends, and you end up getting dragged back into the investigation of the nefarious forces behind the widespread madness that chokes the city.</div><br/><div>While the story in Criminal Origins was deliberately disorienting and brimming with unanswered questions, Bloodshot makes a point of explaining the seemingly unexplainable insanity that has been a driving force in the series so far. It's not necessary to have played Criminal Origins to appreciate the grimy setting and relentless brutality of Bloodshot, though the story revelations probably won't resonate if you haven't. If nothing else, the conclusion of Bloodshot leaves you with the promise of something exciting and different in Condemned 3.</div><br/><div>Like Criminal Origins, the action in Bloodshot is an 80/20 split between hand-to-hand combat and forensic investigation, though it expands on and adjusts both in a number of meaningful ways. First-person melee combat is an exceptionally difficult concept to pull off convincingly, due to the disconnect from your “body” that's felt in most FPS games, where your presence in the world is defined by the barrel of your gun. While there are a handful of firearms in Bloodshot, ammo is usually scarce enough that you'll be using your fists, along with whatever else you can pick up, to take on your enemies most of the time. Even when there are firearms at your disposal, you'll likely opt for the hands-on approach, just because it's so damn satisfying. The mechanic of guzzling bottles of hard liquor to steady your aim with firearms is an entertainingly morose idea, but you just can't beat caving in a dude's skull with a rod from a foosball table.</div><br/><div>The basic combat assigns each of your fists to a different button, and pressing both at the same time will allow you to block or parry incoming attacks, almost making it feel like a no-holds-barred boxing game. There's a new combo system that rewards you with more punishing attacks when you're able to land a number of consecutive blows without getting hit yourself, encouraging you fight somewhat intelligently, rather than with pure, blind rage. You can activate chain attacks by double-tapping one of your attack buttons, which will slow down the action and prompt you with a string of button presses which, if done successfully, can result in some exceptionally savage attacks.</div><br/><div>Opponents will drop to their knees when they're at the verge of death, at which point you can grab them and execute them using an environmental kill, which can range from tossing them in a dumpster to crushing their head in an industrial press. Save for an awesome--if shamefully underutilized--late-game addition, the core combat in Condemned 2 doesn't really change that much over the course of the game. The constant change of scenery and the regular introduction of new objects, new combos, and new chain attacks with which you dispense your murderous justice, however, are just enough to keep your attention throughout.</div><br/><div>You'll occasionally take a break from all the bone-crushing violence to do a little crime-scene investigating. You'll use a UV light to turn up blood trails, take photos of evidence with a digital camera, navigate serpentine environments with a GPS unit, and use a spectrometer to sniff out the sonic emitters that are driving everyone totally bananas. The most interesting aspect of the forensic stuff is the way you're rated on the quality of the questions you ask Rosa, your in-ear contact back at SCU, and the accuracy of the evidence reports you submit. The separation between the combat and the forensics still feels a little odd, though by forcing you to do a little quiet meditating on the net results of all this violence, it keeps the game from feeling too relentless.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11990-ss_condemned2_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11990" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11990-ss_condemned2_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11990"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11990-ss_condemned2_03.jpg"/></a><figcaption>AAAAHHHH DOG!</figcaption></figure>A lurid, rundown atmosphere is a significant factor in what makes Bloodshot so engrossing. The environments are consistently filthy and busted, with either harsh lighting that creates lots of unnerving shadows, or no lighting at all, forcing you to rely on your flashlight to make your way. Bloodshot sounds as nasty as it looks, with a static-washed, screaming soundtrack that creates a perpetual sense of dread, sickening thuds and crunches punctuating the intimately punishing combat, and some of the most convincingly rage-filled epithets you'll hear in a game. You'll hear muffled movement and muttering from rooms away, reinforcing the sense that there's someone (or some<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic; ">thing</span>) right around the corner, ready to tear you to pieces.</div><br/><div>The single-player game in Bloodshot is probably about as long as Criminal Origins was, though Bloodshot definitely maintains a better momentum throughout. Bloodshot also features some multiplayer modes that are interesting in theory, but in the plainest of terms, the melee combat just doesn't work well in a multiplayer context. While I'm generally not much of a fan of gore-porn like <em>Saw</em> or <em>Hostel</em>, I loved Condemned 2 start to finish, despite it coming from a similarly depraved place. This game is all raw nerves and bloody fists, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll find plenty of both in the equally damaging Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Condemned 2: Bloodshot.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20465/]]></api_detail_url><id>20465</id><name><![CDATA[Condemned 2: Bloodshot]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/condemned-2-bloodshot/3030-20465/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-03-27 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72852/]]></api_detail_url><id>72852</id><name><![CDATA[Condemned 2: Bloodshot]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/condemned-2-bloodshot-review/1900-15/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-16/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[TiQal has its moments, but there are just too many other, better puzzle games on Xbox Live Arcade.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Here's that Mayan-themed Xbox Live Arcade puzzle game you've been waiting for.

But the gameplay can be summed up as Lumines for lazy people, and presentation is so rote that you'll have to pay close attention to prevent yourself from thinking that you're playing one of the other Live Arcade puzzle games based on an ancient culture.</div><div><br/></div><div>TiQal gives you a widescreen block pit to work with, and the removal rules work like Lumines, so when you create a two-by-two block of the same color, it lights up. You can expand these shapes by dropping more and more of the same colored block, making for large block explosions. Rather than work rhythmically, like Lumines, active blocks in TiQal stay in the pit for a bit, lit up for easy identification. If you can keep dumping blocks onto that combo and extend it, it'll stay in the pit. Leave it alone for too long, and it'll burst, giving you your points and, if it's a big enough break, a power-up or two.</div><div><br/></div><div>The blocks you're given at the top of the screen vary in shape, and you'll unlock more complicated shapes as you proceed through the game. The blocks don't drop on their own. Instead, the pressure comes from the rising of the pit itself. But it doesn't seem to get so fast that it becomes too challenging, and by the time you've advanced far enough in the game to see it get difficult, you'll have accumulated so many extra lives that it won't be much of a hassle to deal with. A meter at the bottom of the screen fills as you break blocks, and when it's full, you move on to the next level.</div><div><br/></div><div>Between levels, you're shown a quick page of text detailing how you're trying to get jaguar teeth or corn or something to offer to the gods of the pyramid you're trying to enter. I'm really not sure who wrote the memo that puzzle games need some kind of half-hearted story, but it feels like a real waste of effort, considering nothing in the gameplay actually changes or plays off of those story bits.</div><div><br/></div><div>If you like, you can play the game with a friend, cooperatively, online or off. This just lets you drop twice as many blocks into the pit and doesn't seem to set up any interesting strategic differences.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's thoroughly unexciting and visually uninspired, but that's more the fault of TiQal's place in history. If it had been one of the first puzzle games on the service, it might stand out a bit more. But now, despite its passable gameplay, it's hard to not just say "wow, they made another one of these?" and move on.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20623/]]></api_detail_url><id>20623</id><name><![CDATA[TiQal]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/tiqal/3030-20623/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-03-31 11:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72462/]]></api_detail_url><id>72462</id><name><![CDATA[TiQal]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tiqal-review/1900-16/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-17/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Viking's got good ideas, but you'll see most of them in the first third of the story.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Viking: Battle for Asgard has some really great things going for it, mostly on the mechanical side. The combat is just deep enough to keep you engaged, and the character upgrades you get feel meaningful. The problem is that everything is counterbalanced by a quest that quickly grows stale and repetitive after its first third. Even the final boss fight is just a minor twist on an encounter you'll have done at least five times before. It all averages out into a likable action game that could have been a lot more.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12000-viking_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12000" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12000-viking_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12000"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12000-viking_04.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Cutting dudes is a major part of being a viking.</figcaption></figure>You play as a burly viking named Skarin, who has been brought back from the dead to be a goddesses' champion. In doing her bidding, you bump up against evil Legion forces controlled by the goddess known as Hel. The entire game is spent with you trying to push back Hel's forces and reclaim territory by freeing trapped humans. Once you've completed all of the tasks in a given area, it's time for your newly-massed forces to rage into battle against a Legion stronghold. These large-scale battles recall some of developer Creative Assembly's previous work with the Total War games, but make no mistake, there are no serious tactics or strategy to be found here. This is strictly action.</div><div><br/></div><div>That means your main way of interacting with the world is by hacking it up with the sword and axe that Skarin always has at the ready or by hammering on a button to untie viking hostages, unlock doors, and open chests. The combat uses a light and strong attack button, and as you play and earn gold, you can spend it at an arena to learn a host of more devastating maneuvers. The combat never gets too tricky, but some of the moves you'll purchase make Skarin a much more survivable guy. It's less combo-oriented than something like God of War, but the handful of Quick Time Event sequences certainly make for some similarities.</div><div><br/></div><div>You'll also upgrade your magic abilities, which come in the three flavors of ice, lightning, and fire. As you kill enemies, you collect red orbs that fuel your magic meter. Activating it drains the entire meter over time, giving you access to the elemental power of your choice. Here's a tip from me to you: choose ice. It freezes enemies when you slap them with your sword, making a second attack a death by shattering. It's the perfect ability for crowd-control, and the other two powers felt entirely useless to me, even with them upgraded all the way. Since money is easy to earn, you'll have plenty of opportunities to upgrade everything and purchase every move before the game's end, so don't worry about making upgrade mistakes.</div><div><br/></div><div>So the bulk of the game is spent setting up for the large-scale invasion missions, and you'll do this by running around to free trapped vikings. Then you'll often have to perform a simple task for them before they'll realize that you're down for the cause and join forces with your army. Sometimes this means taking out a roaming enemy force. Usually it means running a very basic fetch quest. The repetitive action of freeing vikings from different camps by hacking up enemies is Viking's downfall. This might have been a bit easier to take if the game's terrain was more action-packed, but there's nothing to see or do when you're running between points of interest on your map. Enemies don't roam around randomly or anything, making the whole game feel like you're playing delivery man, whether you're delivering death to Legion troops or delivering honey to heal a camp's soldiers.</div><div><br/></div><div>Visually, though, Viking's world is done nicely. There are plenty of instances of good lighting and quality shadows. And despite the fact that there isn't much to do in the world, the world itself does look good, and it's neat how areas transform from dark to light as you free them from Legion control. The lone graphical issue is that when you get into the larger battles, where armies clash around you, the frame rate can take a serious dive. The sound effects leave a lot to be desired, as well. I prefer my vikings to shout and shriek more than the mostly-silent Skarin does, and the death cries from your foes aren't so great, either.</div><div><br/></div><div>Viking: Battle for Asgard has good graphics and some solid ideas at its core, but the lack of content and variety really holds it back. I immediately liked Viking, but as the repetition set in and made it clear that I was in for another six-to-eight hours of the same few activities, my initial impression gave way to disappointment.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20621/]]></api_detail_url><id>20621</id><name><![CDATA[Viking: Battle for Asgard]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/viking-battle-for-asgard/3030-20621/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-04-01 14:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72726/]]></api_detail_url><id>72726</id><name><![CDATA[Viking: Battle for Asgard]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/viking-battle-for-asgard-review/1900-17/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-18/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[It handles like an antique, and it's a little bit light on content, but solid online and an easy charm help keep Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds entertaining.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds for the PlayStation 3 is a game out of time. While the technical sheen of the presentation and the robustness of the online component feel modern enough, the cutely Japanese characters (complete with poorly matched English voiceovers), the all-too-familiar swing mechanic, and limited number of courses and gameplay modes make it feel like 1997 all over again. While the new subtitle might suggest that Hot Shots is finally going to let its hair down, break some rules, think outside the box, incite a paradigm shift, etc., this is about as traditional as video game golf gets. Despite the dearth of much genuine evolution, though, Out of Bounds still manages a pleasant game of golf.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12013-hotshots_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12013" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12013-hotshots_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12013"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12013-hotshots_06.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Maintaining the status quo.</figcaption></figure>The most daring thing that Out of Bounds does with the gameplay is introduce a new advanced swing system, which isn't much more than a new coat of paint for the three-click swing mechanic that dates back to Golf for the NES. You still hit the X button once to initiate the swing, a second time to determine swing power, and a third for accuracy, it just does it without cluttering up the screen with various meters. This requires you to play a little more by feel, though there are still plenty of hints provided to help guide the timing of your button presses. During the back swing you'll see a yellow glint on the club when you're at 50% power, then a red glint when you're near 100% power, and as you swing forward, you'll see a shrinking circular meter around the ball, and the closer to the center the circle is, the more accurate the impact is. If you're a hardcore traditionalist that wants no part of all these scary, newfangled mechanics, the traditional, meter-based swing system is still included. It gets the job done, and there's something to be said for going with what you know, but even the new advanced swing feels like a bit of throwback.</div><div><br/></div><div>Out of Bounds doesn't take many chances with the modes of play, either. The challenge mode represents the meat of the single-player game, challenging you to win a certain number of 9- or 18-hole tournaments before you can go head-to-head against a ranked pro. Win this match and you'll advance to the next rank and begin the process all over again. Ironically, the challenge mode isn't really that challenging through most of it--not to brag or anything, but I got to the fourth rank before I actually lost a match--though once the game decides it's not kidding, it starts coming hard with heavy winds, convoluted putting greens, and opponents who can put up a real fight.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's in the challenge mode that you'll unlock the lion's share of the 15 playable characters and six different 18-hole courses the game has to offer. The characters are all ridiculous in that filtered-through-Japan kind of way, with my personal favorite being Fernando, the cocky salesman with rolled sleeves who will occasionally leave the course via helicopter. Everyone still has the oversized anime look that has defined the Hot Shots look, and though the PlayStation 3 allows them to look more detailed than ever before, there's a woefully limited number of animations and voice samples. Additionally, the added detail, coupled with the exaggerated art style, gives everyone a weird kind of living-doll feel. </div><div><br/></div><div>Characters are ranked, and each has unique stats, but individual characters will improve the more you use them, and the clubs and balls you unlock in the challenge mode can have such an adverse effect on performance that you'll likely end up sticking to one or two characters. You'll also gain access to new caddies, who do absolutely nothing. Watching the caddie run like a lunatic between shots is mildly amusing, but their advice when you're on the green is usually painfully obvious, and occasionally downright inaccurate. The six courses in Out of Bounds aren't quite as outlandish as the players, though expect to see plenty of wildlife on the course, as well as the occasional rally race or hot-air balloon. The courses are well-designed and tend towards a more subtly exaggerated realism, but even with mirrored and long-tee versions, there simply aren't enough. This is especially apparent in the challenge mode, where you'll play the same two courses over and over again for the first several ranks.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12009-hotshots_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12009" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12009-hotshots_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12009"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12009-hotshots_02.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Lining up the meters just right gets you a colorful reward.</figcaption></figure>Live opponents certainly help spice things up, and you can play Out of Bounds locally against friends in either match or stroke games, and you can apply a few custom rules to your matches as well. There's a rule that increases the size of the cup, a rule that adds strokes for landing in a sand trap, and so on. The online play has these same features, but is far more involved, with custom avatars, a full lobby system, and a tournament structure that allows you to reserve your spot in tournaments that happen at specific times in the day, as though it were a tee-time at an actual country club. But, in another turn that reinforces my theory that Out of Bounds was actually developed in the late 1990s, your character and course access in the multiplayer is determined by what you've unlocked in the challenge mode, which sucks if you're just interested in some golf with your friends.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hot Shots fans will probably be getting exactly what they want/expect from the series with Out of Bounds, which is a very tradition-bound golf game whose playful exterior belies some fairly sturdy and familiar gameplay. I've personally been pretty cool towards the Hot Shots series for a while now for these exact reasons, and while Out of Bounds has done little to change my mind, there are worse ways to spend a lazy Sunday morning.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20598/]]></api_detail_url><id>20598</id><name><![CDATA[Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/hot-shots-golf-out-of-bounds/3030-20598/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-04-03 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73057/]]></api_detail_url><id>73057</id><name><![CDATA[Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/hot-shots-golf-out-of-bounds-review/1900-18/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-19/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Show-stopping bugs and a general lack of content leave Mr. Driller Online gasping for air.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>You'd think that a game about the trials and tribulations of an underaged miner whose primary concerns are avoiding being crushed by the countless tons of cascading rock above his head and praying, oh sweet baby Jesus, that he's able to find enough pockets of oxygen to extend his relentlessly grim existence would be a little bit more, I dunno, bleak. But Mr. Driller, and by extension, Mr. Driller Online for Xbox Live Arcade, is about as bright and cheery as video games get. Unfortunately, Mr. Driller Online is plagued by a meager selection of gameplay modes and bug-ridden online play that keep it from being worth the $10 price tag.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12021-mrdrilleronline_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12021" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56315789473684" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12021-mrdrilleronline_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12021"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12021-mrdrilleronline_04.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Mr. Driller has been known to get his drill on.</figcaption></figure>Mr. Driller is, both philosophically and literally, the child of another subterranean Namco franchise, Dig-Dug. But, rather than hunting down fire-breathing dragons and goggled tomato monsters with a bike pump, your objective is to drill down through a field of odd-shaped, multicolored blocks as fast as you can. As you descend, you'll have to dodge the falling un-drilled blocks left above you, and you've also got a constantly depleting air meter to concern yourself with, which you can replenish with air capsules that you'll happen upon randomly. </div><div><br/></div><div>There are a few other concerns, such as blocks that take multiple drills to destroy, blocks that disappear on their own accord, and power-ups that can increase your speed, provide you with a protective bubble shield, or automatically replenish all of your air meter. In addition to Mr. Driller himself, you can play as a variety of other characters, including Taizo--Dig-Douglas to you and me--and each comes with unique stats. The pacing is manic, and it's definitely more action than puzzle.</div><div><br/></div><div>One of the problems with Mr. Driller Online is one that is endemic to the entire franchise. Despite the fact that there have been no less than six ostensibly different Mr. Driller games over the past nine years,  Mr. Driller Online isn't terribly different from the 1999 Japanese arcade original. Some franchises can get away with this kind of recycling, but the gameplay in Mr. Driller is a little too thin to justify it. The problem extends beyond the gameplay, though, as Mr. Driller Online employs fuzzy character sprites that look like they date back to the start of the series. The game itself emanates the kind of sharp tones that you only hear in video games, though the background music is surprisingly organic and catchy, with lots of live instruments and some simple vocals. It almost sounds like a b-side from a Katamari soundtrack, though it's not the only reason you'll want to linger at the menu screen.</div><div><br/></div><div>Perhaps the straightforward gameplay wouldn't be such a problem if there were plenty of levels and modes of play, but in the single-player game there are only two modes, each with five levels that only seem to really differ in background theme. The standard driller mode just has you working your way to the bottom of increasingly deep mines. The quest driller mode does the same, though every hundred meters you're given a new secondary rule that you must abide by, lest the game end automatically. You'll have to drill through sections with a time limit hanging over you, only using a number of air capsules, not using any power-ups, and so on. The quest driller mode provides a nice twist on the standard gameplay, but it's simply not enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>At this point I'd talk about the online component of Mr. Driller Online, though in the greatest of ironies, it's currently busted beyond use, and nearly a week after its release, there are no apparent signs of a patch. It's kind of heartbreaking for me, because I have extremely fond memories of the original Mr. Driller, which, during an era rich with insane Japanese games, was one of the most charming. I would gladly welcome a Mr. Driller game with sharp, HD-friendly graphics, a robust single-player game, and functional online play with open arms, but this isn't it.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20624/]]></api_detail_url><id>20624</id><name><![CDATA[Mr. Driller Online]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mr-driller-online/3030-20624/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-04-07 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72463/]]></api_detail_url><id>72463</id><name><![CDATA[Mr. Driller Online]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mr-driller-online-review/1900-19/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-20/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[If you have a deep love for classic shooters, you should play Ikaruga.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>I'll never be a great Ikaruga player, and that's fine. I've come to terms with that. But that doesn't mean I can't stand at a safe distance and appreciate it from afar. While some people would claim that most 2D overhead shooter worship comes from a very pretentious place that's usually reserved for wine snobbery, you don't need to be some high-falutin' games-as-art nerd to appreciate Ikaruga.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12023-ikaruga_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12023" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12023-ikaruga_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12023"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12023-ikaruga_02.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Ikaruga makes polarity fun!</figcaption></figure>Though, I feel it's necessary to say up front that Ikaruga certainly isn't for everyone. You may hear people go on and on about how it's an amazing, museum-worthy masterpiece. But if your brain isn't wired to appreciate a top-down shooter, no amount of praise is going to make this game seem as special as many claim, and it's likely that most people will find it completely impenetrable. Consider that your last warning on the subject.</div><div><br/></div><div>OK, so Ikaruga? It's an amazing, museum-worthy masterpiece. Though when you break it down and start to talk about it in a mechanical fashion, it might not seem as immediately impressive. It's a five-level top-down shooter with no power-ups. The trick is that you can flip the polarity of your ship from white to black and back again with the press of a button. This is the game's key mechanic, as you can safely absorb same-colored enemy fire, which charges up a homing laser attack. Also, every enemy is colored white or black, as are your shots, depending on your current polarity. You can do double-damage to enemy ships by attacking them with their opposing color. It helps your score and end-of-round rating if you attack same-colored ships in a row, as you can chain together these kills for combo points.</div><div><br/></div><div>Enemies and bullets come at you at a pretty constant rate, and there's a very maze-like quality to certain portions of the game, where you'll have to analyze the pattern of incoming fire, make sure your ship is the right color, and carefully maneuver your way through safely. This gets pretty hard. At the end of each stage, you encounter a boss, and even more bullets head your way, making you think faster to survive the hail of bullets while dealing damage of your own.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's the chain combos that separate Ikaruga from your average shooter and elevate it to some kind of weird art-form. Watching replays of expert players achieve S rankings has an elegant, poetry-in-motion feel that makes you realize that your pathetic C+ ranking is the equivalent of a caveman banging on rocks with an Xbox 360 controller.</div><div><br/></div><div>In fact, that might be reason enough for some people to pick up the 360 version, as it has the option download and show the highest-ranking replays from the leaderboards. So at any point you can go watch someone else play and realize how pathetic you truly are. The catch is that replays can only be saved using the game's default settings, so if you finally stumble your way through the fourth level, you won't be able to show your friends until you can do it without continuing. Yes, by default, continuing is disabled. But you can turn it on for three continues, and you'll earn additional credits as your overall playtime increases, just like the Dreamcast release.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12025-ikaruga_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12025" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12025-ikaruga_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12025"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12025-ikaruga_04.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Get used to seeing this screen.</figcaption></figure>The game looks great and crisp running in HD, and if you're so equipped (or are really good at playing games while laying on your side), you can rotate the view for a vertical view, much like the arcade version.</div><div><br/></div><div>If you're a crazed Ikaruga purist, you should know that the top player on the leaderboards has come out and complained about the accuracy of the 360 version, saying that some enemy placement has changed. And after watching his replay, well... he would know. But chances are you won't notice. The only real negative I can see comes from the online play, which can get stuttery on some connections, making an already-hard game practically unplayable.</div><div><br/></div><div>The only serious obstacle, however, lies with you and your own personal taste for top-down shooters. Just because it's great doesn't mean it's accessible. So keep that in mind as you weigh your options for this $10 XBLA download.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-12069/]]></api_detail_url><id>12069</id><name><![CDATA[Ikaruga]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ikaruga/3030-12069/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-04-21 13:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72764/]]></api_detail_url><id>72764</id><name><![CDATA[Ikaruga]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/ikaruga-review/1900-20/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-21/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[While there's probably a good way to fit the world of Rocky & Bullwinkle into a WarioWare clone, this game doesn't pull it off.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle takes the world of the 1959-1964 cartoon and clumsily crams it into a second-rate WarioWare knockoff. It's not a bad idea, as the large cast of characters and multiple themes bring a number of different frantic and fractured microgames to mind. Well, my mind, anyway. But this Xbox Live Arcade release doesn't capture enough of the look, sound, and feel of the cartoon, making the whole project come off like an unofficial Flash game with shaky control.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12028-rockybull_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12028" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12028-rockybull_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12028"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12028-rockybull_02.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Not even Bullwinkle can stay awake through this one.</figcaption></figure>There are over 100 microgames, and each one is assigned to a different "show," much the same way different games were assigned to different characters in WarioWare. Here, the shows are based on one character or sub-show from the cartoon, giving you a Bullwinkle set, one for Rocky, one for Boris &amp; Natasha, one for Aesop &amp; Son, and so on. Your first goal is to clear all seven of the main shows. A show gives you a randomly selected batch of games from each set, as well as one boss game. You can fail the main games, lose a life, and continue forward, but you'll have to clear the boss game each time it comes up to proceed. Clearing it gives you an extra life and raises the difficulty up a level, making all of the games a bit more difficult. There are five levels of difficulty in all.</div><div><br/></div><div>Most of the games are too simple, like a dart-throwing game where all you do is point crosshairs at a dartboard--you don't need to actually throw the dart. But since you're kept on a short time limit, you need to work quickly. That worked in WarioWare, but here, you're shown a screen telling you exactly what game is coming up next and how to control it, and you have to hit A to proceed to the next game. The pause between games prevents Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle from developing any tension at all. Furthermore, some games have unclear controls. Some games want you to press the two trigger buttons, but the game doesn't make it clear if you should pound them as quickly as possible or build up a rhythm between the two buttons. As a result, I ended up having a fair amount of trouble with games using the triggers. The game also has camera support, which make some games use the camera in lieu of the standard controls. So instead of hitting A, you'll jump up and down, and so on. I gave that a shot and quickly gave up because it didn't seem fun or particularly interesting.</div><div><br/></div><div>As you play, you earn boxtops, which can be used to purchase items, some of which just make it easier to earn more boxtops. Some give you score boosts. The only one that felt useful was a scrooching gun, which adds one more bubble of time to each game's countdown.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game is bright and colorful, and it occasionally looks pretty good. But sometimes the artwork just doesn't look true to the original characters, and all of the movement is very rough, making the whole game move like a bad Flash cartoon. The audio isn't much better. Only a few vocal samples have been included, and most of the trademark music from the cartoon series isn't here. Instead, there's a bunch of too-smooth music that sounds like someone pressed the "give me something inoffensive" button on a piece of sequencing software. A handful of grainy, small clips of the cartoon are also included, but the only show between games or before you start playing, and there's no sound. They're kind of pointless.</div><div><br/></div><div>But then, you could say that the entire game is kind of pointless. It's not awful, but it could certainly be a lot better. As a big fan of WarioWare and Bullwinkle, I can totally see how those two concepts could be mashed together, and I can see how people would think it'd result in something exciting. But this $10 Xbox Live Arcade release fails to excite, leaving behind a game with no originality and not much excitement, either.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20995/]]></api_detail_url><id>20995</id><name><![CDATA[Rocky & Bullwinkle]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/rocky-bullwinkle/3030-20995/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-21 14:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73635/]]></api_detail_url><id>73635</id><name><![CDATA[Rocky & Bullwinkle]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/rocky-bullwinkle-review/1900-21/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-22/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Dark Sector's got great-looking character models, but the slow and repetitive gameplay really holds it all back.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Dark Sector is notable for being the first "next-generation" game announced all the way back in 2004. Back then, it sort of had a stealth-action look to it, like a futuristic version of Splinter Cell. It would have been interesting to see how that game would have turned out, but I have a feeling that the 2006 release of Gears of War made a pretty deep impact on Dark Sector's development, because the final product takes several cues from Gears. Unfortunately, it doesn't clone it well enough to actually be a clone worth playing to completion.</div><div><br /></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12034-darksector_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12034" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0" data-embed-type="image" data-width="480"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12034-darksector_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12034"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12034-darksector_04.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Hayden's a pretty lithe dude, but he moves a lot slower than you'd think.</figcaption></figure>On the surface, Dark Sector seems pretty cool. The character you control, Hayden, is sent into an area that's been infected with some kind of hideous, post-apocalyptic disease, but he's quickly pinned down and infected himself. As you play, the disease takes hold and you unlock new abilities. The first thing that happens once you become infected is that the game goes from being guns-only to giving you a boomerang-like glaive that you can use to chop off the heads of enemies, if you're a good aim. You eventually get a shield, the ability to control the glaive in mid-flight, and the ability to turn invisible for short periods of time.</div><div><br /></div><div>The game also tosses some light puzzle-solving at you here and there. The glaive can be infused with fire, ice, or electricity by throwing it into fire, something frozen, or a power box, respectively. You'll occasionally need to burn things to clear a path or charge up a jammed door with power to proceed. </div><div><br /></div><div>Once you're fully powered up with all the different abilities, you have some options for how to best deal with enemies, but you're always stuck with a few nagging problems. Hayden moves extremely slowly, plodding around the environment like a man twice his size. For a guy who looks like he should be flipping out and beheading enemies like a ninja, the movement speed doesn't make much sense, and it really makes things drag. You can sprint for short periods of time, but the sprint is Gears of War-like in that you lose a lot of lateral control. Again, that's something that makes sense for a linebacker-sized dude like Marcus Fenix, but when applied to a lithe operative like Hayden, it doesn't fit.</div><div><br /></div><div>While you'll be inclined to do most of your fighting with the glaive, you'll also get some guns to work with. You start with a pistol, and as you collect rubles and briefcases with weapon upgrades in them, you can make your weapons better or replace them at black market checkpoints found in the levels. The weapon purchasing and upgrading systems don't seem to be a major part of the game, and you can make it through with limited purchases.</div><div><br /></div><div>Most of the game has Hayden running from place to place, occasionally stopping for an encounter with gun-toting humans or pipe-wielding zombies, neither of which are very smart. Humans will randomly shoot into your cover point without ever getting tactical, and the zombies move too slowly to ever be a serious threat. This reduces most encounters to an easy shooting gallery where the only occasional problem is the range of your glaive and the general lack of ammo for your weapons. Once you earn the power to turn invisible, the game gets even easier, since you can just blink out, run up behind a guy, and take care of business.</div><div><br /></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12031-darksector_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12031" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0" data-embed-type="image" data-width="480"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12031-darksector_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12031"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12031-darksector_01.jpg"/></a><figcaption>If you toss your glaive through fire, you can set dudes on fire with it.</figcaption></figure>The game has a basic cover system, letting you pop in and out of cover to take shots or toss your glaive at distant enemies. Up close, you have a melee attack, and if you get behind someone--which is super-easy with the slow-moving zombies--you can execute them with a finishing move, which triggers a canned animation that shows you snapping a zombie's neck, slitting the throats of some enemies, or just jamming your glaive into the skulls of some creatures. The finisher animations look great and do a nice job of showing off the game's detailed character models, and it's a shame that there aren't more of them, because they get really repetitive. The rest of the game looks pretty good, too, with decent-sized environments and nice blur effects. Hayden's face is probably the only thing in the game that doesn't look so great. It's too flat, maybe? I can't quite put my finger on it, but something about the way it looks and animates just seems totally wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>There's a multiplayer option in Dark Sector that lets up to ten players play one of two modes. One has two teams, each with one Hayden that must be protected. The other puts one player in the Hayden role, with the other players trying to bring him down for the right to be Hayden in the next round. Neither mode is much fun, and the whole game can be a mess if everyone isn't using a good, fast connection. Dying for no visible reason, warping around the map, and other glitches came up pretty consistently in every match I played.</div><div><br /></div><div>Dark Sector feels OK for the first two chapters, but there are eight more to slog through after that, and if I wasn't working on a review of the game, that's probably where I would have stopped. The occasional variety of a boss battle or vehicle sequence doesn't break things up enough to make the campaign an interesting one, either. Between the dreary action, the sluggish movement speed, and the seemingly tacked-on multiplayer, you'll probably want to pass on the whole thing.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20497/]]></api_detail_url><id>20497</id><name><![CDATA[Dark Sector]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/dark-sector/3030-20497/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-04-25 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72424/]]></api_detail_url><id>72424</id><name><![CDATA[Dark Sector]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dark-sector-review/1900-22/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-23/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[NBA Ballers: Chosen One looks flashy at first glance, but you never really feel like you're doing much more than triggering a series of animations.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>NBA Ballers: Chosen One feels like a relic, like an old arcade game that's been given a fresh coat of paint, but no additional gameplay depth.

It doesn't get much deeper than that as you play--each episode is set up with a video from the game's announcer, Public Enemy #1 himself, Chuck D. While Chuck's love of basketball is probably as deep as it can possibly get, hearing him shill for Sprite throughout the game's fourth episode made me die a little inside. Oh well, at least he isn't making a fool of himself on VH1 or anything like that.</div><div><br/></div><div>Each episode is broken up into chapters, each of which has a fighting game-like ladder of matches you must win to proceed. Most of these are pretty standard, though the game starts throwing in weird rules later on, like games where you have to complete combo moves before you win, or games that can only be won using a game-ending level 3 super dunk. It sort of keeps things fresh, but the real problem is that no one bothered to teach your artificially-intelligent opponents how to perform properly in any of these special rules games. Games where you lose if your opponent sinks a three-point shot are never a hassle, because the AI players almost never attempt threes in the first place.</div><div><br/></div><div>I eventually got to a point where the game wanted me to complete three "pass-to-the-crowd" alley-oop dunks to win. After an hour of trying to get the crowd member to pass me the ball fast enough to complete the oop, I turned to the manual, which doesn't offer any assistance at all. A later challenge has you trying to stop your opponent from scoring at all, which hinges solely on if he counters out of your super steal move or not, making it feel more like luck than skill.</div><div><br/></div><div>Aside from these special rules, though, the game is a total pushover. You have a lot of moves at your disposal, but you really only need to trigger the act-a-fool combo every time you get the ball. This brings up a little button-pressing minigame, where you try to hit a button to complete the combo before your opponent can counter by pressing the button faster. If you complete a five-move combo and quickly score, you get three bonus points for that basket. Considering most games play to eleven points, a five-point play is totally crippling, and the AI can never seem to pull it off to stay competitive and rarely breaks in and counters your combo.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12039-nbaballers3_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12039" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12039-nbaballers3_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12039"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12039-nbaballers3_05.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Must have been a bad burrito.</figcaption></figure>With the single-player's group of problems, it's tempting to turn to multiplayer, and the game does have online play. Online, though, it feels like there's just enough latency to make the act-a-fool combos more difficult to counter, which changes the game for the worse. Playing against a local opponent levels the playing field a bit, but you'll still encounter crazy stuff, like the level three super dunk, which ends a game if it hits and can only be stopped by a level two super block. All of the super moves trigger flavorful animations, but there aren't enough of them to keep things flashy or entertaining, and some of them, like all the super shots, which have the ball making 45-degree turns in midair to swish through the net, just look messed up.</div><div><br/></div><div>It has some nice animations and the player models look great, and it's actually pretty decent, in small doses. But everything about the gameplay feels really mechanical and absolutely inorganic, like nothing you're doing with the controller feels connected to the moves that are coming out on the other end. Chosen One's canned moves and button-mashing minigames make it feel like a relic from the PS2 and Xbox era. It's going to take a pretty serious overhaul for Ballers to get up to date and compete.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20685/]]></api_detail_url><id>20685</id><name><![CDATA[NBA Ballers: Chosen One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nba-ballers-chosen-one/3030-20685/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-04-28 10:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73106/]]></api_detail_url><id>73106</id><name><![CDATA[NBA Ballers: Chosen One]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/nba-ballers-chosen-one-review/1900-23/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-24/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[It provides a promising glimpse into the future of Gran Turismo, but the content doesn't justify the $39.99 price tag.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>The things about Polyphony Digital's driving simulation series that have kept me at bay over the years--the self-serious tone, the unapologetic driving model--seem to have been softened up a little bit with Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, at least enough to allow me to appreciate the painstaking detail that goes into making what is essentially a car commercial in motion. As a taste of what the full version of Gran Turismo 5 will offer, GT5 Prologue is successful--I'm now more excited about the release of Gran Turismo 5 than I've been for any other Gran Turismo release. The thing is, Sony's charging $39.99 for what is essentially an elaborate demo. As pretty as everything in GT5 Prologue is, there's just not a whole lot to it.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12049-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12049" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12049-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12049"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12049-10.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Cars!</figcaption></figure>The game includes six race tracks, featuring well-known real-world locations such as Suzuka and Daytona, and around 70 cars provided by a host of different manufacturers. From Daihatsu to Ferrari, there's a pretty good cross-section of car-makers represented here, but don't expect to find much depth to any individual manufacturer's lineup, as most feature only one or two cars. The cars look absolutely stunning, easily some of the most detailed and realistic-looking cars I've seen in any game. The tracks all look great when you're in motion, though if you come to a complete stop you might notice some blurry textures or cheap-looking onlookers. The rough edges only stands out, though, because the majority of the visuals here are so neat and tidy, so impossibly idyllic. With such an apparent obsession with creating clean-looking visuals, I now kind of understand why Polyphony Digital has shied away from including car damage in a Gran Turismo game.</div><div><br/></div><div>There's still no damage model in GT5 Prologue, though the gameplay seems to have been made much more accessible since the last time I checked out a Gran Turismo game. The driving line is now always on by default, and it can change color on the fly to let you know when you need to slow down in order to maintain an ideal line, but perhaps more importantly, the handling just seems more forgiving. It still requires a certain type of smart, technical driving, so you're not going to be drifting your way through every corner, but first-timers are less likely to end up in a spin at the first bend in the road. As welcome as these adjustments are, the Gran Turismo driver AI is still pretty dull, and when combined with the lack of car damage, it's very easy to use the other cars as cushions and just bang your way around corners, effectively stripping away the game's realistic veneer.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12044-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12044" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12044-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12044"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12044-5.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The cockpit view looks great, but you'll probably want an angle that gives you a better look at the road.</figcaption></figure>The single-player progression helps to ease you into things with class-based challenges that start you off with slower, more manageable cars. Each of the three classes consists of ten different challenges, most of which simply require you to finish a quick race with bronze or better, though there are also a few challenges that task you with going from worst to first in a single lap, or achieve a specific lap time against a rolling field of drivers. You'll regularly find restrictions on the cars you can use, whether it be based on performance, region of manufacture, or on a specific model of car, often forcing you to spend some of the money you've earned competing in races on the right car. This can lead to situations where you have to repeatedly replay past events in order to raise the money you need in order to buy the car you need in order to advance to the next challenge. </div><div><br/></div><div>Even with alternate versions of the six tracks included in the game, track repetition is a big problem in GT5 Prologue, and the fact that these are mostly tracks that you've probably already played in numerous other racing games doesn't help. The thing that probably has Gran Turismo fans most excited about GT5 Prologue is the inclusion of online multiplayer, a first for the series. It's functional, but unless you're specifically excited about being able to play Gran Turismo over the Internet, there's not much particularly unique or exciting about it.</div><div><br/></div><div>Generally speaking, though, I like what Gran Turismo 5 Prologue offers, I just don't care for the decision to monetize it. Gran Turismo 4 featured more than 50 tracks and more than 700 cars, so if $39.99 buys you just six tracks and 70 cars in 2008, I don't even want to imagine how much Gran Turismo 5 will cost.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20597/]]></api_detail_url><id>20597</id><name><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 5 Prologue]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/gran-turismo-5-prologue/3030-20597/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-05 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72455/]]></api_detail_url><id>72455</id><name><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 5 Prologue]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/gran-turismo-5-prologue-review/1900-24/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3), PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-25/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Niko Bellic is one of the most human protagonists to ever appear in a video game, and his trials and tribulations make GTA IV absolutely unforgettable.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>In your first several hours with Grand Theft Auto IV, it's easy to want to approach it with a checklist of expectations and start comparing it to what you think a "next-generation" Grand Theft Auto game should be. </div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12054-gta4_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12054" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12054-gta4_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12054"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12054-gta4_05.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Here's that shot of a GTA protagonists firing at something off-camera you were looking for. Collect all 12!</figcaption></figure>- New carjacking animations? Check.</div><div>- Improved gunplay? Check.</div><div>- GPS on the map? Check.</div><div>- Corny-yet-still-somehow-funny jokes? Check.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's natural to want to take that sort of clinical approach to a sequel, but as I moved through Liberty City and became more entrenched in its story, that stuff simply ceased to matter. At that point, and for the rest of the game, the only thing that mattered to me was Niko Bellic, the game's protagonist. Is he going to survive this time? Are his new-found friends going to make it out alive? Will he ever find what he's looking for, and will finding "that special someone" bring him the inner peace he needs? How did every single person he encounters end up so psychologically damaged?</div><div><br/></div><div>That psychological side to the game translates into characters talking about how they feel, and about what they're going through. It's extremely well-written and made a serious impact on me. This isn't the carefree killing-and-carjacking romp you might have expected. The way the characters act made each life harder and harder to take until I found myself rooting for Niko, hoping that he'd find what he was looking for and finally get some peace. Of course, once you've gone on a crime-spree that has you working for just about every different criminal in Liberty City, getting out unscathed simply isn't an option.</div><div><br/></div><div>To say too much more about the specifics of the story would start to detract from your own personal enjoyment of discovering it for yourself. It made a serious personal impact on me, and there were some plot twists that simply made me stop playing for a few hours because it started to hit a little too close to home and started reminding me of people in my own life. Seeing these virtual lives getting torn apart by heroin addiction, depression, or forces beyond anyone's control made an emotional dent on me that no other game has done before. That makes being the man in charge of who lives and who dies even tougher. Later in the game, you'll start to make very tough decisions, where you'll have to kill one of the people you've been working for at the request of the other. By that time, I was so invested in these characters that the choice felt like much more than pushing a button on a game controller.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12056-gta4_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12056" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12056-gta4_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12056"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12056-gta4_07.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Bike are a speedy, but dangerous way to get around town.</figcaption></figure>Though you'll make choices at critical points in the game, the impact on the overall plot is mostly minimal. One choice you make near the game's conclusion makes the most impact of any of Niko's decisions, and the choice you make here determines how some of the final missions go, leading to one of two possible endings.</div><div><br/></div><div>One last thing about the way the story and characters play out: unlike most GTA leads, Niko is no pushover. He's got a sharp, sarcastic tongue and he doesn't just mindlessly follow whoever is giving the orders. This helps acknowledge the insanity that's going on around him and makes him a likable character. Yes, he's out there doing horrible things, but he's not doing it to run some Tommy Vercetti-like empire. He's doing it to survive and to hopefully find some closure along the way.</div><div><br/></div><div>So if you've read this far, you've probably figured out that this is a much darker game than the previous GTA games. Though the tone borders on nihilistic at points, the game is still filled with a bunch of lighthearted humor that exists at the periphery. The game still has a bevy of radio stations, each with its own DJs and commercials that make all kinds of jokes at the expense of American society or the culture of New York City. You can also watch TV in many of your safehouses, and there's a collection of shows there that also provide the same type of humor. News is delivered by the Fox News-like Weazel News, which provides a slanted view of the things happening around town, calling almost everything that occurs a "terrorist threat." The tone of the humor is exactly what you'd expect from the series, though the modern setting makes that humor feel a little more biting. Either way, this time around it also serves the purpose of preventing things from getting too dark and serious. It makes for a nice balance.</div><div><br/></div><div>The majority of things you associate with Grand Theft Auto's gameplay haven't changed too much in GTA IV, though many of the familiar things you expect to see in a GTA game have been refined a bit. Combat, both armed and unarmed, is probably the biggest overhaul. When unarmed, you have two punches and a kick, as well as the ability to block and counter when necessary. But more often than not, you're going to be strapped with a melee weapon or a gun of some kind. The game now has a cover system, letting you stick to walls and other objects, blind fire, and pop out to take a few aimed shots before getting back behind cover. This addition alone makes shooting much easier to deal with than it's been in the past. The game's lock-on targetting has also been tweaked. Overall, most of the people who have had serious complaints about the way GTA handles shooting shouldn't find much to complain about this time around. If anything, it makes things a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; easy, as popping off headshots is a breeze now.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12059-gta4_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12059" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12059-gta4_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12059"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12059-gta4_10.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12059-gta4_10.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Getting a chopper in multiplayer can make you pretty deadly.</figcaption></figure>The bulk of the story is spent with you approaching mission start points, which triggers a cutscene to set up the mission. Then you're off on your task. The things you do in GTA IV aren't dramatically different from what you've seen in previous games, but it feels a lot more grounded in reality this time. You aren't learning how to use a jetpack, or helping someone take over the music biz or anything like that. Instead, you're overseeing diamond heists, shaking down people for protection money, or following gangsters back to their bosses so you can clean them all out at the same time. Throw in some dirty cops, some New York crime families, a shadowy government agent, and a whole lot of Russian mobsters, and you've got a lot of work to do. Failing missions is no big deal, either, because you can easily warp back to the start of a mission after you fail, die, or get arrested. Also, you don't lose all your weapons when you fail, so the time it takes to get going again is pretty minimal.</div><div><br/></div><div>But what if you need some more firepower before taking on the next mission? You're given access to underground gun shops, but it's even easier to get in good with Little Jacob, the friendly neighborhood rasta/dope dealer/gun seller. If you're friendly with him, you can give him a ring on your cell phone and he'll roll through with a trunk full of toys at discounted prices. That's one of the many benefits of maintaining friendships in GTA IV.</div><div><br/></div><div>While you can date girls with mostly-predictable results, you can also cultivate friendships with a handful of the guys you meet throughout the game. You'll occasionally get phone calls from them, wanting to hang out, or you can initiate a play date with your dudes with a call of your own. You can visit strip clubs, go out drinking, play darts, go bowling, take in a set at the local comedy club, play pool, and so on. Getting to know these characters a bit more makes them seem a little more human, and you get some real insight into some of the characters' stories, as well. Or maybe you just want to keep hanging out with Brucie, the genetically jacked steroid monkey who loves cars, VIPs, staying alpha, and "putting bitches to the sword." If you and Brucie become close buds, he'll hook you up with a helicopter. The other bonuses, such as being able to call a cab that will take you anywhere in the city for free, or the ability to rig cars with explosives, certainly make things easier for you.</div><div><br/></div><div>In addition to all the single-player stuff you can do, the game also has an online side that lets up to 16 players join in a variety of modes. Most of them seem fairly standard, like team deathmatch, a pair of racing modes, and an objective-based mode where one team of thugs tries to escape while a team of cops tries to take them down. There are also a few co-op modes for up to four players, but calling these "modes" is a bit of a stretch. They're more like individual missions that you can play again and again. They're fun, but they feel like a tease because there are only a few of them and they don't change much, so once you get good at them, they're a breeze. All they do is make me wish that the game had a larger co-operative component to it, because they're probably the most interesting part of the multiplayer mode. There's also a free mode that lets you and 15 other players run around the city with no real objective, which can be fun if you just want to screw around.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12050-gta4_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12050" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12050-gta4_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12050"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12050-gta4_01.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12050-gta4_01.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The over-the-shoulder aiming in GTA4 makes combat a bit easier to deal with.</figcaption></figure>Getting into and out of the multiplayer mode is done via your in-game cell phone. It's a pretty slick integration, but it's not without its issues. For example, if you run into any network trouble and can't join a match, you're kicked back to your single-player game, where you have to pull up the phone and try again. If you set up a game and realize you want to change modes, you have to quit all the way back to your single-player game and try again. Switching to some kind of multiplayer menu once you get into the multiplayer side of the game would work better.</div><div><br/></div><div>All of this stuff is put together into a great-looking package. Liberty City really comes alive in GTA IV, thanks to some terrific building design. The environment looks rich and realistic, and makes the GTA III-era Liberty City look like a bunch of flat facades by comparison. The visual quality also really helps in the cutscenes, because the facial expressions of the characters can effectively convey emotion as they deliver lines, which helps give the story its impact. Animation-wise, the characters move well and there are lots of little touches, such as the over-the-top stumbling that Niko and friends do when they've been drinking, that help make the game look great. The frame rate is mostly stable and it runs at a playable speed, provided you aren't getting too crazy. When piling cars together in an attempt to make a huge explosion, I managed to get the frame rate down into what looked like single digits. Also, the game doesn't always convey a great sense of speed. When you're in the faster cars, the whole game seems to skip along, rather than giving you a fast, smooth look at the world. It never gets so choppy that you can't handle your vehicle, but it's very noticeable, especially on the 360.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game is backed by some terrific audio, from character voices to the soundtrack, to the sounds around you. Niko's footsteps are especially well-done. They'll echo off nearby buildings if you're running across a quiet street, and they'll generally reflect the surface you're running on--like the metal walkways of a cargo ship, for example--really well. The gunfire sounds great, car engines are appropriate, and plenty of pedestrian dialogue helps make the city feel complete.</div><div><br/></div><div>The soundtrack is, once again, all over the place, with enough variety to keep you hearing new things for quite a long time, provided you're open to scanning around the radio dial a bit. At some point during my time with the game, I discovered that I sort of like dance hall. Weird! The DJs, commercials, and talk radio stations are great, and deliver the perfect level of ridiculous satire mixed with dick jokes.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12052-gta4_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12052" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12052-gta4_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12052"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12052-gta4_03.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12052-gta4_03.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Niko's a pretty complicated guy.</figcaption></figure>This is the first time in a long time that a GTA game has debuted on multiple platforms, and of course, people are going bananas trying to dissect every little difference they can. From my time with both versions, I found the PS3 version to run a little smoother, though neither version is immune to drops in the frame rate when things get crazy. The PS3 version installs up front and seems to load and stream a little better as a result. The 360 version's loading and streaming is entirely dependent on the quality of your hardware's DVD drive. On one system, I had no problems, the loading seemed perfectly snappy, and it generally wasn't a thing. On the Xbox 360 Elite I have at home, though, I could hear the disc thrashing about as it tried to load, and occasionally objects and roads would appear a second or two too late, causing me to ram my car into invisible objects, in one case. Thankfully, I had another 360 at my disposal, but if your drive is already a little iffy, just know that you might run into some occasional streaming issues.</div><div><br/></div><div>Of course, the 360 version has achievements and will apparently have downloadable content down the line, so if I were choosing, that's the direction I'd lean in. But the story is just as great on both platforms, and you really can't lose either way.</div><div><br/></div><div>It was difficult to anticipate how Grand Theft Auto IV would turn out, given the way that the whole "open-world game" thing is being done to death across as many different games and settings as possible. Rather than try to out-do the Crackdowns and the Saints Rows of the world with bigger land masses and more missions, Rockstar went the other way, and managed to craft an amazingly impactful story and weave it into an open-world game in an incredibly meaningful way--all without losing the heart and soul of what makes Grand Theft Auto so popular in the first place. The end result is absolutely masterful and absolutely worth your time and money.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20457/]]></api_detail_url><id>20457</id><name><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto IV]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-05 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72362/]]></api_detail_url><id>72362</id><name><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto IV]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-iv-review/1900-25/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-26/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Mario Kart Wii lives up to series expectations in the safest ways imaginable.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>During my time with Mario Kart Wii, the theory was proposed to me that Nintendo has ceased trying to evolve its franchises, opting instead to simply remake their trademark games for each new generation of players, and I think the Mario Kart franchise serves as a powerful Exhibit A for this argument. In my experience, if people have a favorite Mario Kart game, it's usually the first one they played. Mario Kart Wii is by no means bad, but it seems built for first-timers, and those looking to recapture what it felt like to be a first-timer. It delivers just about everything you expect from a Mario Kart game, both good and bad, making for an experience that can be fun, but never surprising.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12062-mariokartwii_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12062" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56473489519112" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12062-mariokartwii_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12062"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12062-mariokartwii_02.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Mario Kart Wii in action.</figcaption></figure>So expect to see your usual roster of Mushroom Kingdom denizens power-sliding their way around serpentine courses peppered with jumps, boost pads, and crazy obstacles. There have been some modifications and some additions to the stock Mario Kart experience, but these are minor refinements, not evolutionary jumps. There's a whole host of different control schemes, including a motion-control option that makes use of the little plastic steering wheel shell that comes packed-in with the game. I could see the Wii wheel being fun if I had never actually driven a car, but the novelty doesn't make up for the lack of precision for me. I personally found that a GameCube controller or a remote-and-nunchuk combo produced the best results, and if I didn't have an irrational distaste for the Classic Controller, that'd probably work pretty well, too. </div><div><br/></div><div>In addition to the different character weight classes, there are now a number of different karts and motorbikes to choose from, each with a unique handling profile that can have a very dramatic effect on how the game handles. If you run a couple grand prix races in a kart, then switch over to a bike, expect to bring up the rear for a couple races. Both bikes and karts can perform stunts in mid-air, resulting in a little shot of boost when you hit the ground. Bikes are essentially two-wheeled karts, though when you're on a bike you can pop a wheelie for extra speed on a straightaway, and bikes don't get the second level of yellow sparks that karts can get by holding an extra-long power-slide. Despite all these variables, the basic Mario Kart rule of “Always Be Drifting, Except When You Shouldn't” still applies across the board.</div><div><br/></div><div>The structure of the game is predictably familiar. Single-player revolves around grand prix races that come in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc varieties, though you can also run time trials, create custom races, or partake in the consistently tedious battle mode. I found the grand prix stuff fun, right up until I got to the 150cc level, at which point my Mario Kart skills buckled under the crushing force of random chance. With inherently solid controls, Mario Kart Wii, and by extension, every other Mario Kart game, could be an accessible, skill-based racing game, if it weren't for all those goddamn power-ups, and the game's serial habit of giving the most potent power-ups to last-place players. What's the fun in skillfully outmaneuvering 11 opponents for three laps only to wind up in 12th following a barrage of blue shells, POW blocks, and thunderheads in the final stretch? It's always been frustrating, and it remains frustrating. </div><div><br/></div><div>The multiplayer options are bolstered by the inclusion of online play, which kind of alleviates the sad fate of playing Mario Kart all by yourself, albeit in the silent, heavily insulated world of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, where it's difficult to play with friends and strangers at the same time. Maybe I'm just jaded, but it's 2008 y'all, the simple inclusion of online play is no longer enough to set my world on fire. I'm also a little bothered by the track selection in Mario Kart Wii. There are 32 different tracks here, a full half of which are straight-up remakes of tracks from past Mario Kart games. To be fair, a number of the new tracks are fun and inventive, and I understand why some people would be excited about the inclusion of so many tracks from past Mario Kart games, but for me it just reinforced the feeling that, yup, I've totally already played this game before. </div><div><br/></div><div>Mario Kart Wii is a good game stunted by its audience's apparently insatiable appetite for the exact same thing, over and over again. The addition of online play and motion controls are good, but they're also the most predictable choices possible. Personally, I'm completely tired of getting exactly what I expect.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20645/]]></api_detail_url><id>20645</id><name><![CDATA[Mario Kart Wii]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mario-kart-wii/3030-20645/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-07 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72512/]]></api_detail_url><id>72512</id><name><![CDATA[Mario Kart Wii]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mario-kart-wii-review/1900-26/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-27/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Target: Terror looks like it was a lot of fun to make, but that doesn't mean it was a lot of fun to play.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>In some weird alternate dimension, arcades still matter in North America and the classic quarter-sucking games of the 80s and 90s are still absolving us of our pocket change while simultaneously keeping us out of the house under the guise of "going out and doing stuff." In that reality, Target: Terror came out and was lovingly received by a gaming public that still cares about things like full-motion video and light-gun games.</div><div><br /></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12067-targetterror_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12067" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12067-targetterror_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12067"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12067-targetterror_03.jpg"/></a><figcaption>And the winner of the Best-Dressed Terrorist award is...</figcaption></figure>Here in our dimension, though, Target: Terror came out to today's arcades: empty, lifeless places full of the damned and people who just don't know any better. There's probably some sales chart somewhere that pegs this game, which you might as well call "Area 51: Dudes With Shirts Over Their Faces Instead Of Aliens... Gold," as a success in today's arcade market. Someone somewhere probably considers it "a real earner" in their bowling alley or laundromat or wherever it is that people are hiding arcade games in this day and age. But then Konami somehow decided to pick up a Wii port of the game. And it's, you know, bad?</div><div><br /></div><div>Or maybe Target: Terror is great. At the very least, it looks like it was a lot of fun to make. The game is mostly comprised of dated-looking pre-rendered environments that scroll around on a track as a piece of full-motion video in the background. Terrorists and civilians are superimposed on this footage, and you need to shoot (or not shoot, in the case of innocents) them before they shoot you. If your gun is empty, you reload by firing while pointed off the screen. The part that looks like fun is that all of the people you can shoot are digitized humans, who go through a little animation routine, switch into another one if shot, and make their way off screen. My favorite is "guy with dynamite under his jacket," who pops up close to the screen when you aren't paying attention and rips his shirt open with a zest for living that I haven't had in decades. Actually, my favorite is the girl who plays the newscaster at the beginning of each level. They shot her against a green screen, as well, but apparently they didn't have any actual microphones, so she's just reading fake news in some echoey room, probably using whatever mic was built into whatever camera they were using. This game feels super low-budget across the board, but in a sort-of-funny way.</div><div><br /></div><div>But being hella budget doesn't excuse Target: Terror. It's way pixelated, the Wii Remote doesn't do a great job of simulating a light gun, it doesn't even run in 480p, and as a game meant to extract as many quarters from your pockets as possible, it's jittery and fast, making it really tough to avoid damage as you work through the game's scenes. Someone, somewhere is able to play the arcade version of this on one quarter. If you encounter him, do not take this gentleman on his up offer to give you a ride home! It will only end in tears, several years of forced servitude, and a shallow grave near mile marker 117.</div><div><br /></div><div>You're given 30 continues on your first attempt, and when you discover that isn't enough, the game lets you start over with 40 continues on your second attempt. That probably won't be enough, either, but by that point you'll have played way more Target: Terror than you should have played, whether you're playing alone or with a friend.</div><div><br /></div><div>As I played Target: Terror, the thing I realized is that I'd rather be watching a "making of" video for all of the terrorists. I have a feeling it involved a lot of people hanging out near a green screen, slapping on sunglasses, tossing on a bubble vest, wrapping a T-shirt around a head or two, and acting like lunatics in front of a video camera. Instead of spending the $40 on Target: Terror, I recommend you wrap a T-shirt around your head and film yourself pretending to be a ninja, a terrorist, or a ninja terrorist. Then post it online and send it to your friends.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20460/]]></api_detail_url><id>20460</id><name><![CDATA[Target: Terror]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/target-terror/3030-20460/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-07 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72369/]]></api_detail_url><id>72369</id><name><![CDATA[Target: Terror]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/target-terror-review/1900-27/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-28/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[You might not enjoy every single game type that Boom Blox offers, but most of them are a lot of fun, especially if you're playing with friends.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Boom Blox is one of those products that blurs the line between game and toy. While it has the levels and general structure needed to provide you with a clear sense of progression through its challenges, there's something to be said for just tossing bowling balls into huge towers of blocks and letting physics take it from there.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11650-Beaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11650" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11650-Beaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11650"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11650-Beaver.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Nobody not likes to play baseball!</figcaption></figure>The game gives you a lot of different ways to play around with that basic concept, both alone and with up to four players. Once you've gotten over the game's built-in variety, you can get into the level editor and create some wild stuff of your own, then share it with your friends via the internet.</div><div><br/></div><div>The key thing about Boom Blox is the level of control you have. You mainly interact with objects by tossing or shooting things at them. Shooting is a point-and-click endeavor, but throwing things has a lot more finesse to it. First you point at the screen and use B to rotate the camera, then hold A when you've lined up your shot. To toss, you cock back your arm, make a throwing motion, and let off the A button to release. The harder your throwing motion is, the harder your toss. While getting used to how fast you need to move your arm to throw hard can take a little time, it's pretty easy to pick up.</div><div><br/></div><div>The grab tool gets a bit trickier. Instead of just lining up a shot, locking on, and tossing, the grab tool lets you get your hands on individual blocks and pull them around. Sometimes you can be wild with this, but it usually requires a very steady hand and some slow, even movement on your part. That's because most of the grab tool games in Boom Blox are effectively Jenga, where you're trying to pull objects out of a mess of blocks without disturbing the pile too much.</div><div><br/></div><div>The Jenga-style games, which you can play alone or with others, is probably my favorite thing to do in Boom Blox, but there's a lot of variety to be found. The game starts you out trying to use the fewest number of baseballs to knock down all of the gem blocks in a level, and as you go deeper you'll discover how the different block types interact. There are bomb blocks that explode when hit, chemical blocks that explode when two of them connect, vanish blocks that disappear when you strike them, and so on.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game's adventure mode brings a collection of cute, block-shaped characters into the proceedings, some more directly than others. This sets up games where you're helping a little mustache-wearing critter "mine for gold" by blowing a hole in a structure with a bomb ball, then tossing rubber balls into the hole. Any blocks touched by the rubber ball light up gold and count for your score. The last couple of games in the adventure mode ended up being my least favorite. Both of them have you protecting kittens from skeletons, one set using the grab tool to place obstacles to slow down the enemies and clear a path for the kittens, and another where you can shoot or toss balls at the skeletons to keep them away from the kittens. They both can get pretty frustrating, and it shines a bit of a light on the way the game's progression keeps things pretty inflexible. If you get hung up on a puzzle and you aren't willing to switch over to multiplayer mode or go create a level, you're basically stuck.</div><div><br/></div><div>The multiplayer offers co-operative games, competitive games, and attack games. The Jenga-like mode counts as a competitive game, where players take turns removing blocks from a pile and attempt to keep the whole thing from toppling over. The castle attack games are neat, too, giving players big castles with gem blocks in them. The goal is to knock out all of your opponents' gem blocks before you get taken down in kind. With a good amount of variety to it, the multiplayer mode can really take you a long way.</div><div><br/></div><div>Of course, if you do get tired of what Boom Blox has to offer by default, you can go in and edit existing levels or create new ones from scratch. The creation tools aren't much different from the grab tool you use in the main game, so it's somewhat intuitive, but it requires a steady hand if you want to make something specific. I found that I didn't really have the patience to make anything too elaborate, but if you're into level creation, you'll probably like what Boom Blox delivers in this area.</div><div><br/></div><div>Boom Blox would be a shell of a game if it didn't have the graphical prowess to back up its concept. The game has a charmingly simple look to it that might not wow you right away. But the game doesn't fall apart with a lot of objects are moving around on-screen, and that's what really matters in this case. When you start setting up elaborate, bomb-filled levels that send everything flying all at once, it's good to know that the game can usually keep up with you, and that's what makes it look great, overall.</div><div><br/></div><div>While some of the trickier puzzles may take some real time to master, especially if you want to get a gold medal on every challenge, it doesn't take a lot of time to acclimate yourself to Boom Blox and whip through most of what it has to offer. The lasting value, then, comes from the multiplayer, which is an absolute blast, and the creation aspect, which, to be fair, isn't for everyone. Still, with so many different things to do and so many different ways to do it, Boom Blox seems like the sort of game that just about anyone can have a great time with.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20466/]]></api_detail_url><id>20466</id><name><![CDATA[Boom Blox]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/boom-blox/3030-20466/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-12 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72376/]]></api_detail_url><id>72376</id><name><![CDATA[Boom Blox]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/boom-blox-review/1900-28/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-29/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Defend Your Castle's charming visuals and low price tag help compensate for some simple gameplay.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Defend Your Castle, one of the first titles released in North America through Nintendo's newly minted WiiWare service, is less a game than it is a distraction, a simple and clever-looking novelty that baits you with some simple strategy that ultimately doesn't really go anywhere. You might call it a time-waster, but not a complete waste of time, due largely to Defend Your Castle's endearing, seemingly improvised visual style.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12069-defendyourcastle_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12069" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12069-defendyourcastle_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12069"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12069-defendyourcastle_02.jpg"/></a><figcaption>It's all about dragging dudes to death.</figcaption></figure>Like so many classic time-wasters, Defend Your Castle began its life as a web-based Flash game--in fact, you can totally use the Internet channel to play the original Flash version on the Wii, if you care to. From a gameplay perspective, the WiiWare version is virtually identical. You've got a static screen with a simple, four-cornered castle on the right, and little stick-figure invaders charge towards it from the left. You can deal with basic foot soldiers by grabbing them with your cursor and flinging them into the air, allowing gravity to do the rest. Once you've accrued enough points from killing enemies directly, you can spend those points to upgrade the defensive and offensive capacities of your castle. </div><div><br/></div><div>In between rounds you can repair damage taken, increase the amount of damage you can take, and build towers for archers, magicians, masons, and bombers. Perhaps most important is the conversion pool, which you can drop enemy soldiers into, turning them into friendly soldiers that you use to fill your various towers. How you choose to allocate your soldiers is the most strategic thing about Defend Your Castle, though it's often easy to compensate for poor allocation choices with some speedy soldier-flinging.</div><div><br/></div><div>So you've got some real-time combat, and some simple resource management, but the basic gameplay remains mostly static from one round to the next. Rounds get longer, enemies become faster and more numerous, and you can unlock some additional spells for your magicians, but it's not much. Also, pro tip: the game takes its sweet time ramping up the difficulty, to the point that you're probably better off just ignoring the normal difficulty and going straight for heroic. There's four-player support in here as well, which adds the fun little kink of rewarding the top-scoring player in each round with the sole ability to allocate soldiers and activate magic attacks in the following round. Really, the best thing about the gameplay is just how seemingly manic it can get at higher levels. </div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12070-defendyourcastle_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12070" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12070-defendyourcastle_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12070"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12070-defendyourcastle_03.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Between levels you can upgrade your castle.</figcaption></figure>If all you want is gameplay, then Defend Your Castle isn't really worth the 500 Wii points they're asking. But much of the game's charm comes from its visuals, which also helps set it apart from its Flash-based predecessor. Defend Your Castle looks like an arts &amp; crafts collage made from whatever the artist had around, giving the whole thing a tactile, hand-crafted quality. The background looks like construction paper laid over a cork board, with passing clouds dangling from bits of yarn. Your cursor looks like a bread-bag clip. Soldiers appear to be crayon drawings topped with shirt buttons or bottle caps and googly eyes, with some being armed with broken popsicle sticks or explosive rings of cap-gun caps. Even the explosions just sound like someone making an explosion sound with their mouth. </div><div><br/></div><div>The presentation goes a long way towards making Defend Your Castle a worthwhile experience, but after a few hours of fending off hordes of DIY enemies, I was done with it. There's a much more involved, much more interesting game to be made here, though I suppose part of the appeal of Defend Your Castle is that it's relatively low-impact gaming.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20502/]]></api_detail_url><id>20502</id><name><![CDATA[Defend Your Castle]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/defend-your-castle/3030-20502/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-18 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72430/]]></api_detail_url><id>72430</id><name><![CDATA[Defend Your Castle]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/defend-your-castle-review/1900-29/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii Shop]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-30/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness is as entertaining as its title is long.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One represents a significant role-change for Penny Arcade. Writer Jerry Holkins and artist Mike Krahulik have built a tidy little empire largely through commentary about video games and the peripheral culture. Now they're on the other side of the fence, working with developer Hothead Games to create what is probably best described as an episodic adventure RPG. This first installment lays some very promising groundwork with a setting and style that betray the creators' nerdier passions, some exceptionally funny and ribald writing, and gameplay that is brisk and engaging.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12090-pennyarcade_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12090" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12090-pennyarcade_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12090"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12090-pennyarcade_05.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The dialogue sequences turn the polygonal characters back into their normal, 2D selves.</figcaption></figure>Despite its relative popularity, Penny Arcade is still pretty niche, and it would've been easy to “give the fans what they want” and just copy-and-paste the characters and settings from the strip into some safe, established game template. Instead, On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness conjures up an alternate reality for the Penny Arcade staples to flourish in. The game takes place in the city of New Arcadia circa 1922, where steam-powered technology exists alongside diabolical supernatural forces. Playing as a character of your own creation, you'll head off on an adventure alongside Tycho Brahe and Jonathan Gabriel of the Startling Developments Detective Agency shortly after a gigantic, fruit-sodomizing robot crushes your house. </div><div><br/></div><div>Holkins' affection for steampunk aesthetics and the Cthulhu mythos come through loud and clear in Episode One, as do a comical disregard for hobos and mimes. My appreciation of Penny Arcade has always stemmed from the writing, and it's in top form here, alternating between high-falutin', convincingly nonsensical jargon, and unbridled vulgarity. The game is action-packed with highly entertaining writing, from the snappy dialogue to the seemingly endless item descriptions, all of it really pulling you into this world they've created. There are plenty of touches both big and small to appease fans, from the significant role of the Fruit Fucker to a sandwich-board advertising a performance by the Kansas City Hot-Steppers. That said, nothing about this odd union feels particularly forced, and you don't have to be a fan to enjoy story threads about an insane urinologist (that's the science of urine, folks!) and the certification process of “hobeef.”</div><div><br/></div><div>On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One has the volume of dialogue trees and item collection you might expect from a straight adventure game, but there's nearly as much combat in here as there are jokes about pee. Whenever you encounter an enemy--be it animate trash, a barbershop quartet, or some evil goddamned mimes--the game cuts away to a battle mode like it was a Japanese RPG. The combat is a mix of real-time and turn-based conventions, giving you control of all three characters at once, but limiting how often you can use them with action meters that fill up over time. Depending on how long you let a character's meter charge, you can use items, perform a basic attack, or activate a special attack, which prompts a quick minigame to determine how much damage you deal. If two or more characters have their special attack ready, you can perform a team-up attack. </div><div><br/></div><div>You'll want to keep your eye on the battlefield during all this, for messages about enemy weaknesses, as well as to block incoming attacks. There are other variables, such as support characters you can tag in and the random-meter-filling “roll for initiative” that kicks off every fight, but the core combat is inherently active enough to keep you constantly engaged. Engaged, but not particularly challenged, since the game gives you an overabundance of helpful items, and there are no discernible penalties for losing a fight, other than having to fight again.</div><div><br/></div><div>There are a few other things about the game's execution that nagged at me every so slightly. I don't think Mike Krahulik's art style translates to 3D very well, which makes it good that the game peppers plenty of 2D stills and animation throughout. The presentation relies on some comic-book flourishes that feel a little out of place, given that little else in the game evokes much of a comic-book feel. It's also a curiously quiet game--the only voice is that of a narrator who takes off after the first few minutes, music is used sparingly, and even the footfalls of your characters are oddly muffled. </div><div><br/></div><div>But none of these issues put much of a dent in my overall enjoyment of On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One. It took me a good five hours to play through, and it wraps up enough story threads to be satisfying, while leaving enough open to keep me eager for Episode Two. If the humor and the combat can retain this level of quality, this could be the start of something great.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20696/]]></api_detail_url><id>20696</id><name><![CDATA[Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episode One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/penny-arcade-adventures-on-the-rain-slick-precipic/3030-20696/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-05-22 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72510/]]></api_detail_url><id>72510</id><name><![CDATA[Penny Arcade: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episode One]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/penny-arcade-adventures-on-the-rain-slick-precipic/1900-30/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-31/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[It's hard to consider some of these early Neo Geo releases as "classics," but at least there's a good variety of game styles in SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>While SNK is usually remembered solely for its rich catalog of high-quality fighting games, there's a lot more to the company's history than King of Fighters or Mark of the Wolves. SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 for the PSP and PS2 shines a light on some of the other Neo-Geo games in the company's archives with a compilation of 16 games. Unfortunately, the emulation gets a little shoddy in spots and the PSP version, in particular, has pretty lengthy load times.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12091-snkacv1_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12091" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12091-snkacv1_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12091"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12091-snkacv1_01.jpg"/></a><figcaption>It can be a little tough to get excited about some of these older SNK releases.</figcaption></figure>The package covers a decently wide array of older Neo-Geo releases and includes Art of Fighting, Baseball Stars 2, Burning Fight, Fatal Fury, King of the Monsters, Last Resort, Magician Lord, Metal Slug, Neo Turf Masters, Samurai Shodown, Sengoku, Shock Troopers, Super Sidekicks 3, King of Fighters '94, Top Hunter, and World Heroes. Many of these are earlier Neo-Geo releases and don't show off the great graphics and fluid animation found in later releases on the long-lasting home hardware, so some of this stuff only works in a nostalgic sense. Once you've played the later games in the KOF series, for example, it's hard to care about the first one. Also, I would have liked to see The Super Spy included in this list, but then, I already own a copy of it in its original form.</div><div><br/></div><div>There are some specific emulation issues that pop up in both versions of the game. A lot of the audio sounds off, like it's being loaded up separately and plays a half-second later than it should. This usually only occurs the first time you hear a sound, like it's loading up the sounds and then caching them for later use. Some sounds are noticeably of a different quality than other, similar sounds, like the pre-fight speech in Samurai Shodown--the lead-up to the fight sounds crystal clear, but the word that actually starts the fight sounds muffled and lo-fi. Shock Troopers freezes up for split-seconds here and there whenever it tries to play new sounds. It can get pretty annoying.</div><div><br/></div><div>The package contains some concept art and move lists, but you can't see any of it right away. Instead, each game has a set of specific, achievement-like medals to earn, with a variety of tasks, such as getting a birdie in Neo Turf Masters or beating a fighting game on the highest difficulty. Each medal unlocks something else, and you actually have to pick up ten medals to unlock World Heroes. </div><div><br/></div><div>If you have a soft spot in your heart for any of these old big-cart classics, you'll probably be able to overlook the emulation issues and load times, but some of these early Neo-Geo games don't hold up so well today, so make sure you know what you're getting yourself into before you commit.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20463/]]></api_detail_url><id>20463</id><name><![CDATA[SNK Arcade Classics V.1]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/snk-arcade-classics-v1/3030-20463/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-06-10 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72373/]]></api_detail_url><id>72373</id><name><![CDATA[SNK Arcade Classics V.1]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/snk-arcade-classics-v1-review/1900-31/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-32/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Commando 3 makes a pretty good first impression, but the rest of the game doesn't offer enough excitement to carry you through to the end.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Here in the US, we might not think of Capcom's Commando as being part of a series. That's because the sequel was released domestically as Mercs, rather than Commando 2. Now, we're faced with a new sequel from Capcom and developer Backbone Entertainment, known as Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3. It probably has more in common with Mercs than with the orignal Commando, but what's more, it's gone from the more-traditional top-down shooter format of the previous games to the now-standard dual-joystick format. So it feels more like some long-lost relative of Midway's Total Carnage than a true sequel to Commando or Mercs, but its real problem is that the game just isn't very exciting.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12094-captivate_c3_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12094" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12094-captivate_c3_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12094"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12094-captivate_c3_3.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Commando 3 doesn't feel quite like a true sequel to Commando or Mercs.</figcaption></figure>Like Mercs, Commando 3 is a three-player game. You can play with multiple players locally or online, though the game is probably a bit easier if you choose to go it alone. You'll pick one of three characters, each with different statistics for health, speed, and how many grenades you can hold. The game is a basic scrolling top-down shooter, with dual-joystick controls, so your left analog stick moves and the right one shoots. You can also lob grenades or unleash an M-Crash, which is a sort of smart bomb that damages everything on-screen.</div><div><br/></div><div>There are five levels to play through, and things start off reasonably slow. This seemed fine the first time I played it, and it made me think that the rest of the game would pick up the pace. While things do get harder, Commando 3 doesn't reach any kind of frantic pace, even on the hardest difficulty setting. The main reason why games employ the dual-joystick control configuration is to make it easy to fire in multiple directions and separate the firing from the moving. But in Commando, you're moving along at a sluggish pace, and the enemies usually only come from directly ahead of you and directly behind. So you never feel surrounded or, really, like you're in any kind of serious danger. </div><div><br/></div><div>There's a real lack of enemy variety, as well. The main soldiers, who tote AK-47s and occasionally even fire them in your general direction, look slightly different from level to level but behave the same way. There are also a few bigger guys that might have chain guns or rockets, and a few vehicles for you to blow up. You'll occasionally encounter a vehicle of your own, though the vehicle control is kind of terrible. Three of the levels end in boss fights, but two of them are against the same large tank, which has a slightly different attack pattern the second time around. Commando 3 is, in a word, monotonous.</div><div><br/></div><div>But monotonous isn't broken. There's a simple charm to Commando 3's visual style, especially its cartoonish menu art. Of course, those hints of individuality only serve to make the gameplay a little more disappointing. As a package, Commando 3 isn't bad, but the only thing likely to give players a sense of lasting value is the inclusion of the Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix beta in the 360 version, and that doesn't even go out until June 25.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20467/]]></api_detail_url><id>20467</id><name><![CDATA[Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wolf-of-the-battlefield-commando-3/3030-20467/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-06-17 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72541/]]></api_detail_url><id>72541</id><name><![CDATA[Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wolf-of-the-battlefield-commando-3-review/1900-32/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store, PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-33/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Wii Fit's simple workouts run out of charm pretty quickly, but for some, the subtle nudge to get on a better workout plan will be worth the price of admission.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Wii Fit accomplishes exactly what Nintendo representatives said it would prior to its release: it makes its users more cognizant about what's going on with their bodies and, along those lines, it made me think a little bit more about my overall health... for about four days.  After waking up to Wii Fit for less than a week, my interest in the simple stretching and balance exercise waned, leaving me on the hunt for a more intense and interesting workout than Wii Fit and its balance board can provide.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12103-wiifit_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12103" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12103-wiifit_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12103"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/12103-wiifit_01.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Breathing, stretching, and balancing are the keys to Wii Fit.</figcaption></figure>So that's the rub. On one hand, Wii Fit's collection of minigames wasn't really enough to keep me coming back. On the other, it managed to get me thinking about getting back on my old workout plan, and also gave me a quick look at my posture and weight distribution. In a way, I'm thankful for that, but that doesn't exactly translate into an immediate recommendation that you should run right out and spend $90 on the board and game package, especially now that it's become a hard-to-find item that many retailers are bundling or selling for more than its original $89.99 price point.</div><div><br/></div><div>Wii Fit is broken up into two sections. The first is a scale, center of balance calculator, and calendar. Here you tell the game how tall you are, you stand on the board, and it weighs you. This info is used to tell you if you're overweight or not, using the sometimes-controversial Body Mass Index rating to decide. It also lets you know if you're evenly distributing weight between your feet, or if you're resting back on your heels too much.</div><div><br/></div><div>The calendar is for setting weight loss goals. While the game will warn you if you set an overly aggressive goal, it seems like the game should be able to look at your weight and perhaps suggest some goals, rather than leaving you to guess at it until it stops warning you.</div><div><br/></div><div>There are also some simple balance tests you can take in this section of the game, and all of this data is combined to form your Wii Fit age, which is just as scientific (and just as dopey) as the way Brain Age would determine the age of your brain. The first time I stepped on and took the test, the game claimed my Wii Fit age was ten years above my actual age. After playing it for two days, it started claiming I was two years younger than my actual age, even though I had only lost around four pounds. It's a senseless statistic that will probably confuse people who don't already know how the same number works in the Brain Age games.</div><div><br/></div><div>The rest of the game is a collection of minigames that pose as exercises. They're broken up into multiple categories, such as strength training, yoga, and aerobic activity. The yoga involves a lot of stretching and breathing, but all the game is really interested in tracking is how well you balance yourself while stretching. This feels like a minor point in the overall scheme of things, since it isn't measuring how well you're able to bend and perform some of the different yoga poses. Regardless of that, the game doesn't really provide you with any set warmup or cooldown exercises, and the yoga poses work well for that.</div><div><br/></div><div>The strength training has you doing pushups on the balance board, or performing torso twists, and so on. The aerobic section has you moving a bit more, but since the board can only sense your balance and how often you're stepping on it, it doesn't feel like it's built to really gauge your performance. There's a jogging mode built in, but jogging in place on your floor while holding the Wii Remote so the game knows you're actually moving doesn't seem like a very effective workout.</div><div><br/></div><div>There's that rub again. Wii Fit didn't strike me as a very effective workout device, yet it got me thinking that I needed something better, rather than making me think I needed to stop waking up 30 minutes earlier for some morning exercise.</div><div><br/></div><div>Once you've outgrown the activities in Wii Fit, the yoga may still come in handy as a warmup, and the scale and calendar can be used to track your progress, regardless of your workout plan. With that in mind, Wii Fit is a decent package, and it works exactly as advertised. But you may outgrow it quickly. Unless you're already convinced that you'll want other balance board games down the line, you're probably better off just going for a nice, long walk.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20503/]]></api_detail_url><id>20503</id><name><![CDATA[Wii Fit]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-fit/3030-20503/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-06-24 13:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-76485/]]></api_detail_url><id>76485</id><name><![CDATA[Wii Fit]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wii-fit-review/1900-33/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-34/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Soul Calibur gets the fighting right, but without online play or the single-player mission mode that made it fun to play alone, this XBLA re-release is a flimsy package.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/303298-sc_xbla.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-303298" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/303298-sc_xbla.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-303298"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/303298-sc_xbla.jpg"/></a><figcaption>But the soul still burns?</figcaption></figure>You know, my least favorite thing about the Soul Calibur series has been Namco's unwillingness to stick to one spelling and capitalization scheme for the series. At some point, Soul Calibur became SOULCALIBUR and, in some cases, was also listed as SoulCalibur. But regardless of how Namco is spelling it this week, all you really need to know is that this Xbox Live Arcade release is a lightly updated remake of the first game in the series that offers the same gameplay that made it such a hit on the Dreamcast back in 1999. But the featureset is more in line with the arcade version, and it lacks online play, making it feel like a $10 teaser or a demo for the latest game in the series rather than something you might actually want to add to your collection.</div><div><br/></div><div>For those unaware, this is a weapon-based 3D fighting game featuring all manner of characters, from samurai dudes with samurai swords to armored ladies with a sword and shield to a dude with nunchuks and a hairdo that screams "rockabilly date rapist." Then there's a sword ghost, a bondage fiend, a dual-wielding pirate, and Yoshimitsu from Tekken. There's a pretty good variety overall, covering the standard range of speed and power.</div><div><br/></div><div>But chances are you probably already know a thing or two about Soul Calibur, considering how popular it was on the Dreamcast. This version faithfully duplicates the gameplay and looks reasonably nice for a cleaned-up version of a game that's been around for close to a decade. It's sort of lame that the game doesn't let you expand to fill 16:9 displays by just showing more background or, as an alternative, cutting off the top and bottom a bit to change the aspect ratio. Instead, you're left with a tastefully mute Soul Calibur wallpaper that surrounds the game screen.</div><div><br/></div><div>The real problem with this re-release is the lack of features. Modern releases of fighting games have online play. Even the remakes and downloadable re-releases of the classics on Xbox Live Arcade have adhered to this standard, and Soul Calibur feels pretty empty without it. If you're living in a neighborhood full of people who are down to play Soul Calibur, maybe this isn't an issue for you. In my neighborhood, where I'm the only one who's even remotely interested in any fighting game at all, it's a deal breaker.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's like salting a wound, then, that this version of the game also lacks the enhanced single-player options that made the Dreamcast version so rich. You get team battle and a pair of survival modes, as well as practice and a basic museum mode full of concept art and voice tests. The mission mode from the Dreamcast game isn't here, which was the sole reason to care about playing this game by yourself in the first place.</div><div><br/></div><div>In highly conditional situations, I could see recommending this re-release to someone. It's a quality fighting game and it's $10. But all the caveats weigh heavily on the full package, and left me feeling like I was playing half of a game.</div><div><br/></div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-12411/]]></api_detail_url><id>12411</id><name><![CDATA[Soulcalibur]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/soulcalibur/3030-12411/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-07-25 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-74003/]]></api_detail_url><id>74003</id><name><![CDATA[Soul Calibur]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/soulcalibur-review/1900-34/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-35/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit is by far and away the best looking Dragon Ball Z game available today. Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't match the visuals in terms of recreating the action and appeal of the source material.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that I'm a fan of the Dragon Ball Z series. I've always thought if any property could be turned into a great fighting game it had to be DBZ. It has engaging characters with over-the-top powers and an epic sense of action. So, you're probably saying to yourself “Oh boy, fanboy Vinny is going to give Burst Limit 18 stars!” Well, as much as I'd like to tell you that this is the DBZ game to challenge the non-believers, it's just not quite there yet. If you're a fan of the Dragon Ball Z series you'll be happy to know that Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit provides enough winks and nods to satisfy despite its relatively limited campaign and roster. Judged strictly as a fighting game, Burst Limit comes up short in terms of depth and diversity.<br/><br/></p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5756/267429-burst_limit1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-267429" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5756/267429-burst_limit1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-267429"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5756/267429-burst_limit1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Welcome to Vegeta's Sisyphean Hell.</figcaption></figure>Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit includes your standard set of game types like online, survival, arcade, and a story mode called Z Chronicles. You'll begin with only a few of the 21 playable characters, but you can unlock the rest during your playthrough of the story mode. <br/><br/>For me, the bread and butter of a Dragon Ball Z game is how well the story and the actual fighting are integrated into the game. If you think you've seen every conceivable rendition of Goku vs. Frieza, rest assured, Burst Limit forges some new paths in this well-trodden area.<br/><br/>The Z Chronicles will take you through the Saiyan Saga, the Frieza Saga and the Cell Saga, which is fine, because everyone knows all that GT crap that came later is bonkers. Still, it does seem a little abridged considering previous Dragon Ball Z games included every saga, season, movie, fan fiction, “what-if scenario” and even some stuff that was just plain made up. Each saga has approximately 15-20 battles that progress in a linear fashion, with the occasional optional battle thrown in. Burst Limit does a great job of letting you play as the appropriate character in each battle, avoiding the awkward and frustrating occasions of demolishing an opponent only to discover that in the following story elements you actually lost the fight. This was a serious disconnect in previous iterations of the franchise, and it's a welcome improvement in the implemenation of the storytelling. The game also tries to capture some of the ever-escalating intensity of each battle by peppering in story elements throughout a battle. If you meet certain conditions within a fight you'll unlock little scenes called Drama Pieces. These Drama Pieces not only share more of the decidedly thin narrative with you, but they will also imbue temporary buffs and debuffs in you and your opponent. These can range from a temporary increase in Ki regeneration to actually inflicting some minor  damage on your opponent. These scenes are charming for fans and they are a clever way to reference particular moments during your favorite battles.<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/104386-Dragon_Ball_Z__Burst_Limit-Xbox_360Screenshots19817S01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-104386" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/104386-Dragon_Ball_Z__Burst_Limit-Xbox_360Screenshots19817S01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-104386"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/104386-Dragon_Ball_Z__Burst_Limit-Xbox_360Screenshots19817S01.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Finally, a game that does Raditz's mane justice.</figcaption></figure> <br/>Now, when it comes to translating the...<i>robust</i>...Dragon Ball Z story into video game form, the series has had mixed results. Burst Limit takes the approach of "what you don't know won't hurt you." It strips down the story elements into the most significant fights throughout each saga and gives you only a few lines of exposition before and after each battle. If you're a fan of the series you can usually fill in the narrative gaps, but if you are new to the series you will be completely lost. You'll jump from Earth to Namek with no explanation; watch characters die and mysteriously resurface a few battles later; and, sadly, be left wondering if you're missing something or if this what Dragon Ball Z has to offer. For the folks in the know, scenes from the anime are authentically reconstructed in-engine, sometimes shot for shot, but for the uninitiated, the non sequiturs in the story will leave many scratching their heads.<br/><br/>Now here's my biggest gripe with the Z Chronicles, and possibly the entire game. After you complete a saga you can watch a movie that includes great narrative moments that would have tied together many of the battles in which you just participated. It's really a shame these scenes couldn't be used in conjunction with the conspicuously missing narrator to flesh out more of the story and add a bit of investment and meaning to the battles. It's almost as if all the elements were there for this great narrative in the story mode and someone was like “Eh, this is taking too long, throw it all in at the end.” Big mistake, and a real disappointment.<br/><br/>The fighting in Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit is fairly pedestrian and you won't have a problem jumping into the shoes of other characters. There are two main physical attack buttons, one for strong and one for regular attacks, and a ki blast button. In addition you have buttons for blocking, throwing and a button which acts both as a more powerful ki-enhanced block and a sort of ki-toggle to enhance your other attacks. If you're new to the series, you can think of ki as magic or mana; it's what allows your character to perform his most powerful moves.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/104380-Dragon_Ball_Z__Burst_Limit-Xbox_360Screenshots19810WatchOutNappa%20_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-104380" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/104380-Dragon_Ball_Z__Burst_Limit-Xbox_360Screenshots19810WatchOutNappa%20_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-104380"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/104380-Dragon_Ball_Z__Burst_Limit-Xbox_360Screenshots19810WatchOutNappa%20_000.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/104380-Dragon_Ball_Z__Burst_Limit-Xbox_360Screenshots19810WatchOutNappa%20_000.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>You'll rarely find yourself short on ki.</figcaption></figure>You have a constantly refilling ki meter at the bottom of the screen, but unlike previous games in the series, the meter won't deplete just from launching a fireball or two. You'll need a full ki meter to use your Ultimate Attack, but for other signature moves you'll only dent the meter if you fire it at full power while holding down the ki-enhance toggle. Letting your ki meter fill will also allow you to trigger your Aura Spark, which puts you into a sort of ki infused combat state. While Aura Spark is activated your ki meter will constantly drain but you'll gain unique combat abilities such as being able to easily warp behind your target and initiate a punishing pursuit attack. The other benefit of filling your ki meter is that it will allow you to change forms, which, depending on your character, will make you more powerful at the expense of your defense.<br/><br/>There isn't much in the way of variety from each character, aside from different special moves. With the exception of Piccolo, who has a considerably longer reach than other characters, you'll be using the same basic attacks and techniques throughout the game. The AI won't let you spam special moves over and over, so you'll have to get in close for some fisticuffs, but once you get familiar with the controls you'll find yourself pulling off the same sequence of moves again and again. That being said, the battles are generally fun and move at a pretty good pace. The Drama Pieces add enough of a tweak during a battle that if you don't move your butt to finish off an ailing opponent he can quickly turn the tables and win. The ability to select up to three unique Drama Pieces and customize your character with different Ultimate attacks at the outset of a multiplayer fight adds some depth to the fighting mechanic, but the immediate impact of your choices won't be apparent until you have become deeply invested in the subtleties of the game.<br/><br/>Speaking of multiplayer, I found that it was pretty standard fare for the local mode and hit or miss when it came to the online variety. I encountered some pretty serious lag depending on connection speeds, but when the pings were low the game seemed to handle itself well. There's a surprising amount of timing required to block and dodge moves, so lag will definitely cause more than a few frustrations during a match.<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7233/198824-22937_normal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-198824" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7233/198824-22937_normal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-198824"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7233/198824-22937_normal.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7233/198824-22937_normal.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Yamcha was always popular with the ladies.</figcaption></figure><br/>Considering the original Dragon Ball Z anime first aired almost 20 years ago, watching high-definition Kamehamehas is a treat. The game looks great, and while it would have been nice to see some of the cosmetic damage present in other Dragon Ball Z games, the overall presentation is well-executed. As a fan of the English-dubbed anime, I found the voice acting solid, but not exceptional, with some characters sounding better than others. There is an option to play using the Japanese voices, but for me, the English voices are what I associate with the series and found no reason to switch, unless I was really aching to have Goku sound like a 12-year-old boy.<br/><br/>Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit is definitely more a game for those familiar with the series than players looking for a deep, competitive fighting game. While it's visually engaging, those without an interest in the actual Dragon Ball Z franchise will find the fighting too simplistic to be rewarding. I loved seeing the characters realized in their most detailed and expressive incarnation to date, but unfortunately Burst Limit fails to integrate the over-the-top nature that the anime, and even the developer's previous DBZ game, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3, captured so well.<br/><br/><br/>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20500/]]></api_detail_url><id>20500</id><name><![CDATA[Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-ball-z-burst-limit/3030-20500/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-07-28 11:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72428/]]></api_detail_url><id>72428</id><name><![CDATA[Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Vinny]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dragon-ball-z-burst-limit-review/1900-35/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-36/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 adds new modes and elements that make it significantly better than both its predecessor and the scads of dual-joystick shooters that were released in its wake.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176122-gwre2_screen_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176122" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56220472440945" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176122-gwre2_screen_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176122"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/176122-gwre2_screen_4.jpg"/></a><figcaption>If you're not paying close attention, you might get lost in this mess.</figcaption></figure>It's really interesting to see <a data-ref-id="3030-11099" href="/geometry-wars-retro-evolved/3030-11099" slug="geometry-wars-retro-evolved">Geometry Wars</a> return to the stomping grounds that it helped make famous. As the first big Xbox Live Arcade release when the Xbox 360 launched in 2005, <a data-ref-id="3010-716" href="/bizarre-creations/3010-716" slug="bizarre-creations">Bizarre Creations</a>' vector-style shooter provided a very compelling reason to pay attention to "small" digitally distributed games. It also repopularized the dual-joystick shooter, blowing the concept pioneered by games like <a data-ref-id="3030-11233" href="/robotron-2084/3030-11233" slug="robotron-2084">Robotron: 2084</a> into a full-fledged cottage industry for pro-grade and indie developers alike, totally over-saturating the market for dual-joystick shooters in the process. So it says a lot about the quality of Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 that it can come back to Xbox Live Arcade, over two years later, and absolutely lay waste to all of the other downloadable shooters that have come before it.</div><div><br/></div><div>Retro Evolved 2 manages this by making interesting tweaks to the core gameplay, updating the graphics, and putting additional modes in to ensure that players of all skill levels have something to do. The gameplay changes are mostly focused on scoring. When you shoot an enemy, it drops little dots called geoms, which increase your multiplier when collected. That multiplier stays with you for the entire game, unlike the previous Retro Evolved, which put more importance on staying alive to keep your multiplier up. Also, outside of multiplayer mode power-ups, your weapon doesn't upgrade. You always know exactly how you're going to be shooting. The game also introduces new enemies and obstacles, including a bubbly cloud that's only vulnerable when you carve a path to its creamy center, dart-shaped ships that quickly travel along a set line, and so on.</div><div><br/></div><div>The different modes take these basic ideas and flip them in interesting ways. The modes are locked at first, but as you score points in the first available mode, you earn your way to the next mode. Even players with low skill could probably unlock all six modes within the first couple hours of play.</div><div><br/></div><div>The first mode is called deadline, and it gives you infinite lives. The catch is that it only goes for three minutes, which places more emphasis on quickly dispatching enemies and collecting geoms for a high score, rather than simply testing your survival skills.</div><div><br/></div><div>King mode unlocks next, and this version gives you one life and no bombs. Circles act as safe havens on the screen--enemies can't get into the circle, but once you enter, it quickly shrinks and disappears. Also, you can't fire when you're outside a circle, so finding the right time to dart from a collapsing circle to a fresh one is the key skill.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/207359-image10_full.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207359" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/207359-image10_full.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207359"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/207359-image10_full.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The text at the bottom indicates your achievement progress.</figcaption></figure>Evolved is the third mode, and this is effectively the same as the main mode in the previous game, where you earn additional lives and bombs by scoring points. Unlike the original Retro Evolved, this mode gets tough quickly, so you don't have to mosey around for five minutes or so, waiting for the game to get challenging.</div><div><br/></div><div>Playing Evolved unlocks Pacifism, which gives you one life. You can't shoot at all in this mode, but you'll still have to deal with a never-ending stream of enemies by dodging them and flying through gates, which explode and eliminate nearby foes when you activate them.</div><div><br/></div><div>Waves mode is another one-life mode that sends enemies at you in, you know, waves. This mode focuses heavily on the dart-shaped ships, which come at you from all sides.</div><div><br/></div><div>The final mode is Sequence, which is a level-based progression through the game that gives you 20 levels to play through. You have 30 seconds to clear each stage, and if you die, the game moves on to the next stage, which keeps things moving, but you also sacrifice potential points in the process.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game's achievements give you more to do in each mode, such as "wax on" and "wax off" achievements for scraping the walls of the arena in Pacifism. One full lap gives you wax on, but getting two full laps for wax off is much tougher. The game acknowledges when you are attempting achievements like this, by popping up a counter that shows how close you are to getting it done. Overall, the achievements in this game feel a lot easier than the previous game's were, but that comes down to your own personal skill at Geometry Wars.</div><div><br/></div><div>Each of the game's modes can be played in multiplayer mode with up to four players. You can play co-op, break the players up into teams, or just compete for score against the other three players. The catch is that all of this must be done locally. While there's probably a pretty good technical reason for why such a fast-moving, split-second game might not work so well online, it still stands out as the one thing this game is missing. As such, the main competition comes out of the single-player leaderboards, which are always staring you in the face from the mode select screen, informing you that there's probably someone on your friends list who is better than you are. It's enough to make you crazy. It's enough to keep you up at night.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3508/183420-2668412079_52441ef6da.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-183420" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3508/183420-2668412079_52441ef6da.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-183420"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3508/183420-2668412079_52441ef6da.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3508/183420-2668412079_52441ef6da.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>I continue to hate the snakes most of all.</figcaption></figure>Visually, the game retains the same vector-graphics style that it's had all along, but it also looks much nicer. There are more little details now, like the way parts of the display have a curve to them, like you're viewing the menus through a HUD on <a data-ref-id="3005-99" href="/samus-aran/3005-99" slug="samus-aran">Samus Aran</a>'s visor or something. The game has more colorful effects this time around, and the enemy shapes animate a bit more, flipping around on all axes to give more depth to the game's look. The vectors also have a brighter glow to them. In short, it looks great and new while still maintaining a deceptively simple style.</div><div><br/></div><div>The music and sound are also fantastic. A big part of what set Geometry Wars apart from other games of its type is the way it used sound. Every enemy has a unique sound that plays when it appears on the grid. This is still true in Retro Evolved 2, and it continues to be a very handy feature. Each mode has its own music, including an updated version of the original theme, which appears in Evolved mode. There are some great minor touches with the music, too, like the way it muffles in King mode whenever you're outside of a ring, or the way it halts when you die in Evolved mode, like someone slammed the cutoff knob all the way down while slapping a hand on a record to stop it all at once, only to quickly ramp back up when you respawn.</div><div><br/></div><div>Even if you've grown tired of the seemingly endless cavalcade of dual-joystick shooters that Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved's success spawned on Xbox Live Arcade, the sequel is well-worth its $10 price tag.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21167/]]></api_detail_url><id>21167</id><name><![CDATA[Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/geometry-wars-retro-evolved-2/3030-21167/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-07-30 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73974/]]></api_detail_url><id>73974</id><name><![CDATA[Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/geometry-wars-retro-evolved-2-review/1900-36/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-37/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[It's not a seamless transition, but Civilization Revolution is a mostly successful effort to bring Sid Meier's celebrated strategy series to consoles.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106073-08_10_07_Screenshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106073" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106073-08_10_07_Screenshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106073"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/106073-08_10_07_Screenshot_001.jpg"/></a><figcaption>All that I see is my domain!</figcaption></figure>While I have no prior first-hand experience with Sid Meier's Civilization series, I feel confident in saying that Civilization Revolution is a game not intended for established Civilization fans. Developed specifically for consoles, Revolution streamlines much of the intricacies of Sid Meier's beloved PC turn-based strategy series to make for a much more accessible experience. It's still a surprisingly deep turn-based strategy game, and a pretty addictive one at that. Some of the simplifications feel a little arbitrary, and despite being crafted for the couch, the graphics can chug, and the control scheme occasionally sags under the weight of the strategy. Still, it's very easy to get sucked into that “one more turn” mindset that the series is known for cultivating. <br/><br/>Like its PC-based forebears, Civilization Revolution puts you in the role of the leader of a historical civilization with the goal of conquering the world. There are 16 different civilizations to choose from, each of which comes with a unique set of specific strengths. The different cultures are represented by caricatures of various historical leaders, from Abe Lincoln to Genghis Khan, usually without coming off as aggressively culturally insensitive. From there, the game trades in any of its historical accuracy for defiant anachronisms, with your cartoonish avatar leading your civilization--which can include historical figures from across the globe and throughout recorded human history--for thousands of years. This might upset, I dunno, historical re-enactors? Personally, I found the comic-book crossover quality of the game comforting, letting me know that, despite all the historical trappings, the game wasn't going to take itself <i>too</i> seriously.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106097-Civ_Revolution_017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106097" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106097-Civ_Revolution_017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106097"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/106097-Civ_Revolution_017.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Sounds like someone needs a nap.</figcaption></figure>Unlike most strategy games, which tend to focus entirely on military action, there are four different ways to win a game of Civ Rev. You can win by military might, scientific supremacy, economic prowess, or cultural superiority. While these roads to victory require distinctly different priorities, the technological paths for all four are intertwined. If you focus entirely on one discipline, your civilization simply won't be able to keep up with the competition. It makes for a peculiar balancing act that encourages obsession over the minute details of how your civilization focuses its energies.<br/><br/>In a typical game, you'll start with a single village, and at first, your options for expanding your empire are limited to creating groups of warriors. As you explore the randomly-generated world around you, you'll encounter scattered pockets of barbarians that, when defeated in battle, will often earn you new units and occasionally some new technology. Eventually you'll encounter one of the other civilizations aiming for global domination. This opens up the diplomacy aspect of the game, allowing you to declare war, negotiate short-term peace treaties, and trade technological secrets.<br/><br/>As time passes and your capital city grows, you'll learn about new technology, which facilitates the building of new units, buildings, and wonders. Units are typically military in nature, though they can also include caravans, which you can use to trade with other civilizations, and settlers, which you can use to establish new cities. Buildings will enhance the various aspects of how a specific city grows, while wonders can affect both the growth of the cities they're built in, as well as provide your entire civilization with some specific, sometimes ridiculous advantage. My personal favorite, the Oracle of Delphi, will let you know right before a battle whether you're going to win or not, allowing you to back out without taking any casualties.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106074-08_10_07_Screenshot_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106074" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106074-08_10_07_Screenshot_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106074"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/106074-08_10_07_Screenshot_002.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/106074-08_10_07_Screenshot_002.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Technology can determine the fate of your civilization. Choose wisely!</figcaption></figure>The tech tree is fairly complicated, with access to more sophisticated technologies requiring knowledge of a number of simpler technologies, though the game provides you with a fairly easy-to-read chart to help determine what you need to research next to make it to your ultimate goal. While much of the research process is intuitive, there are some puzzling sidesteps you can make here. For all the historical liberties the game takes, I cannot wrap my head around the notion of a civilization that's able to suss out space travel without ever learning about something as seemingly fundamental as gunpowder.<br/><br/>There are other anachronisms in Civ Rev that I found oddly bothersome. One of the options you have within each of your cities is whether they focus certain resources on developing science or accumulating wealth. It's an essential balance-check from a gameplay perspective, but those don't really seem like mutually exclusive pursuits to me. There's also the pervasive issue of technologically superior military units being obliterated by more primitive ones. What's the point of sinking precious research time into the latest and greatest when your fighter planes are getting taken down by medieval pikemen? Like I said before, I generally enjoy the game's freewheeling approach to cultural evolution, but it opens itself up to certain criticism with its real-world springboard.<br/><br/>I'm really just scratching the surface of the myriad of actions that can happen in a single turn of Civilization Revolution here, but even for an ostensibly simplified strategy game, this all still sounds pretty complicated, right? For the most part, Civ Rev does an excellent job of easing new players into the experience, providing you with a number of different advisors who will explain the implications of the various decisions you have to make. On its easiest difficulty setting, the game is incredibly forgiving, which can be an excellent confidence builder for newcomers--there's nothing worse that getting absolutely destroyed by a strategy game your first time in. Once you start playing around with the higher difficulty levels, though, the AI opponents become downright sinister, easily identifying and exploiting any cracks in your foundation.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106090-Civ_Revolution_009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106090" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106090-Civ_Revolution_009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106090"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/106090-Civ_Revolution_009.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/106090-Civ_Revolution_009.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Grey Wolf of the Barbarians is a totally sweet black-metal name.</figcaption></figure>Civilization has long stood as one of those glimmering examples of a PC game that simply couldn't be done with a gamepad. Revolution gets the job done fairly well, though I definitely noticed certain limitations, particularly later in the game, when my empire was spread to the four corners and I was fighting battles on multiple fronts. The interface simply stops scaling at a certain point, and it can be easy to lose track of what's happening where. The time spent calculating your opponents' moves in between your turns can get inordinately long here as well. The visuals in both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions can get a little choppy at times, though the 360 version in particular can have a hard time simply filling in the landscape in a timely fashion as you scroll around the globe.<br/><br/>In my experience, a single match of Revolution lasts somewhere between three and six hours, and every match--from the founding of your first city in 4000BC to your final turn somewhere in the early 21st century--is self-contained, without much in the way of persistence between matches. Beyond the standard single-player matches, there's a handful of specific scenarios that you can play, as well as an online multiplayer option that smartly limits the time you have to complete each turn. Considering that there are whole games out there that last as long as a single match of Civ Rev, it's hard to hold the meat-and-potatoes gameplay modes against it.<br/><br/>While Sid Meier has been quoted as saying that this is the Civilization game he always wanted to make, Revolution's got plenty of shortcomings, and the scope of its vision can sometimes outstrip its mechanics. That said, this is a really satisfying strategy game, and though it might be old hat for PC players, there are few experiences quite like it on consoles.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20580/]]></api_detail_url><id>20580</id><name><![CDATA[Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/sid-meiers-civilization-revolution/3030-20580/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-07-31 23:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72981/]]></api_detail_url><id>72981</id><name><![CDATA[Civilization Revolution]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-revolution-review/1900-37/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-38/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Even if you are a hardcore Aerosmith fan, this game's short and spotty track list makes it hard to recommend.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/187861-aerosmith.png" data-ref-id="1300-187861" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/187861-aerosmith.png" data-ref-id="1300-187861"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1840/187861-aerosmith.png"/></a><figcaption>Steven Tyler wants to wear your skin!</figcaption></figure>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is, according to Activision, just the first of many band-specific Guitar Hero games--a concept that I inherently find to be pretty questionable. It doesn't help that Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is a pretty slapdash product which features fewer songs, a narrower range of songs, and no DLC support, yet it commands the same premium price as Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. A deep appreciation for Aerosmith is an obvious necessity to really enjoy this game, but even then it's missing a number of tracks by the Boston quintet that seem rather essential.<br/><br/>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith uses the same familiar single-player progression as previous Guitar Hero games, challenging you to complete songs in groups of five before moving on to the next set. Cleverly, the game presents each set as a full concert performance at some critical point in Aerosmith's career, starting with Aerosmith's very first performance in a high-school gym, and ending with their induction into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame. <br/><br/>It's not All Aerosmith All the Time, though, with the first two songs in each set being provided by bands that have actually played with Aerosmith, including Cheap Trick, The Clash, Run DMC, The Black Crowes, Ted Nugent, and more. With the exception of Run DMC's “King of Rock,” which unnervingly features a digital DMC mouthing both vocal parts, the opening bands are all portrayed by the same house band seen in Guitar Hero III. <br/><br/>Once Aerosmith takes the stage, though, you'll be treated to a muppety, dead-eyed version of the band. The mo-cap looks authentic, but the exaggerations of real, recognizable people border on grotesque, with Steven Tyler looking more like an iguana than usual. There are grainy, quick-cut interviews with the bones-and-bones members of Aerosmith in between sets. The details here are thin, and it's disappointing, if not terribly surprising, that the game glosses over the band's drug-fueled meltdown in the late 70s.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/187859-aero_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-187859" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/187859-aero_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-187859"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1840/187859-aero_2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Hey look! Guitar Hero!</figcaption></figure>The Grand mal disappointment of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, though, is that it's oddly lacking in Aerosmith. There are but six sets of songs in the game, and with the first two songs in each set coming from opening bands, that means you get a scant 18 songs in the single-player game from the band whose name is on the front of the box. There's an additional 11 Aerosmith and Aerosmith-related songs you can unlock outside the main game, including a number of surprisingly good, bluesy Joe Perry solo songs, but there are some considerable gaps in the Aerosmith catalog. <br/><br/>You get most of the greatest hits, as well as a good amount of late-period filler, but the game all but ignores the band's best-selling 1993 album <i>Get a Grip</i>, omitting essentials like “Cryin'” and “Crazy,” as well as “I Don't Want to Miss a Thing” from the <i>Armageddon</i> soundtrack. Yeah, they're big, cheesy power ballads, but they're some of the band's most recognizable songs. It's telling that “Train Kept a Rollin'” serves as the big finish here, when it appeared a good six months earlier as just-another-song in Rock Band.<br/><br/>Besides charging the same price as Guitar Hero III while providing just a fraction of the songs, what bothers me most about Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is the fact that, not long after its release, it was made essentially obsolete by the announcement that the next full installment in the Guitar Hero franchise would follow the Rock Band template of letting you play a variety of instruments. I think there's some merit to the notion that games like this may be the future of commercial music, but the execution here reeks of an outdated mentality.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20684/]]></api_detail_url><id>20684</id><name><![CDATA[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/guitar-hero-aerosmith/3030-20684/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-01 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72638/]]></api_detail_url><id>72638</id><name><![CDATA[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/guitar-hero-aerosmith-review/1900-38/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-39/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Unreal Tournament 3 is a competent Xbox 360 shooter that can be exciting and very fast-paced, but it occasionally feels like some kind of creepy history lesson on the way games used to be.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/219155-928117_20050518_screen001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219155" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.857421875" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:85.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/219155-928117_20050518_screen001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219155"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5892/219155-928117_20050518_screen001.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Malcolm shows up in the story mode just enough to let you know that he's still a bad dude.</figcaption></figure>In these days of persistent weapon or ability unlocks, party systems, and pseudo-realism, a first-person shooter like Unreal Tournament 3 feels like a relic from the distant past, when all you needed was a fast-moving game of deathmatch to keep the crowds entertained. While there's something to be said for honing a classic style of gameplay to a sharp point, that doesn't exactly make Unreal Tournament 3 a must-have Xbox 360 game, either. While it throws in a few odds and ends that didn't appear in the other versions, the lack of support for user-created content strips away one of the major things that the series still had going for it. What's left is a decent, but pretty unimpressive first-person shooter.</div><br/><div>UT3 is just as multiplayer-focused as its predecessors were. So yes, there's a single-player game, but it's really just a series of matches against bots wrapped around a handful of cutscenes to move it along. The story's pretty goofy this time around, as it's gone from a sport to full-on war. This makes things like Capture the Flag matches seem a little pointless, so the game tries to justify its modes in the context of an actual war by claiming that the flag is really a "Field Lattice Generator" that somehow helps the enemy by allowing them to respawn in the area. It's sort of funny, but the game made more sense when it was a futuristic sporting event.</div><br/><div>The typical modes you'd want from this sort of first-person shooter are present, though the game is broken up with a very distinct line. Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel, and Capture the Flag matches are your standard shooter-style matches, with the sort of map variety you'd expect from an Unreal Tournament game. Then there's Vehicle CTF and Warfare, which are larger maps that allow you to jump in a variety of vehicles. Warfare is a node-based mode where you have to capture nodes linked to your base and capture your way across the map, eventually exposing the enemy base to attack.</div><br/><div>While you may end up loving every single mode in the game, it seems that most of the player base is interested in playing Warfare matches, which never felt like UT's strength to me. The game's fast pace really lends itself to very sharp, very skill-based deathmatch and other small-map gameplay. Either way, with a seemingly small base of players to begin with, spreading them all across all these different modes makes it difficult to find a cluster of players in any of them, especially if you're trying to get players to join your campaign mode game. I played quite a bit of the campaign in an open match and never had one person join it. So that mode seems like it's really only possible with friends.</div><br/><div>The gameplay in Unreal Tournament 3 builds on the previous games in the series, with the same basic weapon loadout and movement mechanics. So yes, you can double jump, yes, you can use the flak cannon, and yes, the bio rifle is still totally lame. Some of the movement doesn't translate to the Xbox 360 so well, though. Rather than giving you control of crouching, the game automatically ducks whenever you get near a vent or anything else that requires you to crouch. A decent solution, but it still feels really weird every time it happens. Also, the double-tap on the movement keys--used to lunge in any direction in the PC version--works a little differently here. It seems that if you're double jumping while moving, it'll turn that second jump into a more directional lunge. If you're used to the movement options of the PC game or any previous UT game, it'll feel weird.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9065/487759-ut3_2007_12_20_12_42_29_45.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-487759" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9065/487759-ut3_2007_12_20_12_42_29_45.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-487759"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9065/487759-ut3_2007_12_20_12_42_29_45.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Shock combos are still a neat way to do damage.</figcaption></figure>The Xbox 360 port also does away with customizable characters in favor of a series of set configurations of humans, undead humans, robots, and so on. The models look fine--actually, the whole game looks quite good, with a lot of the same dark-and-often-brownish level design you've come to expect from gritty Unreal Engine 3 games. It runs at a nice frame rate on the 360, even if you're playing in the new two-player splitscreen mode. The audio is full of raucous explosions and angry yells from the fighters, as well as the same sort of Mortal Kombat-inspired announcer you'd expect.</div><br/><div>While it's tempting to just label UT3 as "old-school" and claim that anyone who is into this sort of thing will be into this sort of thing, Unreal Tournament 3 doesn't feel like a good fit on the Xbox 360. It's a predictable entry in the series, and it's also competing in what's still the most competitive genre on the platform. I ended up liking UT3 for its constancy--at times it feels like a warm handshake from an old friend. But it also feels totally routine from start to finish. The lack of user-created content--which is possible in both the PC and PS3 releases of the game--only drives this feeling home that much harder. As such, UT3 on the 360 is OK, but from a features standpoint, it's also the least desirable version of the game.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-10955/]]></api_detail_url><id>10955</id><name><![CDATA[Unreal Tournament 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/unreal-tournament-3/3030-10955/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-06 13:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72641/]]></api_detail_url><id>72641</id><name><![CDATA[Unreal Tournament III]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/unreal-tournament-3-review/1900-39/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-40/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Soulcalibur IV's sharp fighting is offset by a dull set of single-player modes and lame guest characters.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Soulcalibur IV has a lot going for it. It looks great, for one. It plays pretty well, for another. But at the same time, most aspects of the game totally turn me off. Whether it's the "story" mode that consists of bad endings and weak opening text, or the way the item statistics always seem to conspire to make your characters look ugly when you customize them, every positive moment I had with the game seemed like it was immediately countered by something that made me just want to stop playing it entirely. If all you're looking for is fighting in the Soulcalibur style, you'll be satisfied. But the complete package feels a little weird.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7645/436131-940048_20080715_screen002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-436131" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7645/436131-940048_20080715_screen002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-436131"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7645/436131-940048_20080715_screen002.jpg"/></a><figcaption>These dudes are so totally fighting.</figcaption></figure>The fighting sticks to what you'd expect from the series, even if you're like me and haven't really followed the series terribly closely since it was on the Dreamcast. It's a weapon-based game that, for the most part, focuses on clashing weapons, rather than supernatural attacks. This makes the game flow at a different pace than most other 3D fighting games, as Soulcalibur puts a greater emphasis on parrying and countering incoming attacks to create openings. Since the different fighters all bring different stuff to the battle, this gives everyone a different speed or range that you have to constantly consider while playing. On its own, it's pretty good. Enhancements to the series this time around include the critical finish, a fight-ending move that can only be performed under very specific circumstances.</div><br/><div>The roster in Soulcalibur IV is already pretty deep, with over 30 characters to choose from. But Namco Bandai decided to revive with the whole "guest character" concept from Soulcalibur II. So the 360 version gets Yoda, the PS3 version gets Darth Vader, and both games get The Apprentice, who will be the main character in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed later this year. Much like Heihachi, Link, and Spawn before them, the characters aren't a great fit with rest of the SC lineup. Everyone's going to have his or her own opinion on this stuff, and here's mine: the inclusion of a bunch of gimmicky Star Wars characters cheapens the entire game and comes across as a desperate attempt to get people excited about a game they would otherwise skip. Of course, the fact that you can't even have Yoda battle Darth Vader means that even this attempt at spiking interest in the series comes off as half-assed. Yoda's height makes him especially lame--he's effectively the Gon or Dr. Bosconovitch of the Soulcalibur universe.</div><br/><div>Like previous games in the series, you can create custom characters or edit the outfits of existing fighters. The custom characters need to be assigned to an entire moveset, though, and the weapon comes with the moveset. So underneath the pirate hat and pigtails, you're still just making a different-looking Siegfried or Taki. The way you customize your character effects that character's stats in certain modes, also. This has the side effect of making pretty ugly-looking characters in an attempt to get the stats you're looking for.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4441/225617-sc9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-225617" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4441/225617-sc9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-225617"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4441/225617-sc9.jpg"/></a><figcaption>It's like combining Gon and Dr. Bosconovitch into one totally uninteresting package!</figcaption></figure>The stats and abilities you can slap on your created characters can make them pretty interesting. You may have to sacrifice a large amount of your offensive or defensive potential to get some of the higher-level abilities, though. You can find varying levels of many abilities, like Nullify Ring Out, which makes it tough to get knocked out of the ring, or Venom Fang, which poisons your opponent when you hit and drains life until they hit you back.</div><br/><div>Online, you can get into a match that either uses the different equipment stats or a standard fight that ignores them. It seems to work just fine most of the time, and the only real issue I could see there is that the game doesn't seem like it's taking your online statistics into account when matching you up. I kept getting into fights with players with much higher rankings than mine, which might be frustrating if you're hoping to find evenly matched opposition.</div><br/>The characters look terrific from a technical perspective. The models are nicely detailed and the animation looks great. A lot of the characters feel a liitle over-accessorized, and being able to slap on all kinds of weird hats and pauldrons in the edit mode doesn't really help. You can strip them down a bit, but considering that Ivy already looks sort of weird with her freakishly large and barely covered boobs, maybe it's best to just leave them as-is.<br/><br/><div>Overall, it's sort of hard to recommend Soulcalibur IV to anyone who isn't already a big fan of the series. It felt like everything I liked about the game (the actual fighting) was countered by something else (the meaningless story mode, equipment stats, Ivy's creepy-looking boobs) that made me want to take the disc out and put it away forever.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20678/]]></api_detail_url><id>20678</id><name><![CDATA[Soulcalibur IV]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/soulcalibur-iv/3030-20678/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-07 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72953/]]></api_detail_url><id>72953</id><name><![CDATA[Soul Calibur IV]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/soulcalibur-iv-review/1900-40/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-41/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Braid asks that you forget everything you know about time.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176594-braid_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176594" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176594-braid_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176594"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/176594-braid_1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>This puzzle would leave Mario a quivering mess.</figcaption></figure>Much has been made of the indie pedigree of <a data-ref-id="3040-89596" href="/jonathan-blow/3040-89596" slug="jonathan-blow">    Jonathan Blow</a>'s <a data-ref-id="3030-20716" href="/braid/3030-20716" slug="braid">   Braid</a>. This is, by and large, a one-man show, and not just on the development side. At the same time that it challenges the player with box-bending time-manipulation puzzles, Braid tells a story of one man's emotional loss and his obsessive hunt for a redemptive Princess. While the actual prose can feel like a mopey-if-imaginative teenager's blog, I still have to applaud Braid for its willingness to focus its storytelling on such personal issues as loss and regret. But the real reason Braid works is its gameplay, which is diabolically clever and incredibly rewarding.<br/><br/>Tim is a heartbroken young man in a suit and tie who must traverse a series of worlds, each with its own set of rules about how time works, in his search for the Princess. His journey is paralleled by memories of a past relationship that went from sweet to sour, but the correlation between the two threads remains ambiguous until the last, revelatory level. There's a navel-gazing quality to the writing that can make it intermittently insufferable. There's also some genuine insight about the often counterintuitive arc of a romantic relationship, and the story compliments the nature of the gameplay nicely. <br/><br/>The game's oddly confessional story makes it easy to shuffle into the indie game name game, but what makes Braid exceptional is that it integrates so elegantly into some really clever game design. There are only two types of enemies, a beige head on legs that bears <em>no actionable similarities </em>to a <a data-ref-id="3015-2891" href="/goomba/3015-2891" slug="goomba">     Goomba</a>, and a pink bunny that pops out of the ground and screeches like a cat. There's no penalty for death, and you could run through the game's five worlds in a few minutes if you cared to. If you did, though, you'd be missing the point, as your <em>real</em> objective is to collect puzzle pieces that have been tucked away behind locked doors and in seemingly unreachable corners of the world.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2739/503487-braid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-503487" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2739/503487-braid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-503487"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2739/503487-braid4.jpg"/></a><figcaption>There's some confusion about which castle the Princess is in.</figcaption></figure>Now Tim can run and Tim can jump, but Tim's most notable ability is time manipulation. With the press of a button you can rewind time all the way back to the beginning of the level. This starts out simply enough in the first world, where the ability to rewind time is mostly used to correct a badly timed jump. In the next world, though, you start encountering objects that are unaffected by your manipulation of time, and following that, you'll find that the passage of time for the world is dictated by Tim's movement across the screen. Move to the right, and time moves forward; move to the left, time rewinds. After that, it just gets <em>weird</em>. Braid uses these different time behaviors to create puzzles that force you to ignore much of what you know about how time and space relate.<br/><br/>As such, Braid can be insanely frustrating, but this seems to be by design. The game is filled with <a data-ref-id="3015-1896" href="/red-herring/3015-1896" slug="red-herring">  red-herrings</a> and double red-herrings. Each world is just long enough that, by the time you've trained your logic muscles to play by a specific, peculiar set of rules, you're off to the next world, where the rules have been changed completely. This constant re-education can leave you feeling punch-drunk. The solutions can take a long, long time to reveal themselves to you, but you feel like the smartest person in the world right after you finish a particularly head-wringing puzzle. Alternately, you may also find yourself giving your TV the finger. <br/> <br/>There are some oblique post-end-game challenges to seek out once you've finished Braid, but for the most part, once you've cracked the code and solved all the puzzles, there's not much reason to revisit it. As such, the recent release of Braid on the <a data-ref-id="3045-88" href="/playstation-network/3045-88" slug="playstation-network"> PlayStation Network</a> doesn't have a lot to offer players who've already been on this adventure, since it's indistinguishable from Braid's Xbox Live Arcade release. If you've not played Braid before, though, everything about it--from the crisp, painterly artwork to the brain-cramping puzzles--still holds up rather brilliantly more than a year later.<br/> <br/>I was initially pretty skeptical about Braid, and it took me some time to get past the game's severe melancholy. I eventually found the game's story and the way it plays against the gameplay to be academically interesting, and the game's final payoff is terrific, but it's the ingenuity of the mechanics that makes Braid so engaging.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20716/]]></api_detail_url><id>20716</id><name><![CDATA[Braid]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/braid/3030-20716/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2009-11-25 08:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72515/]]></api_detail_url><id>72515</id><name><![CDATA[Braid]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/braid-review/1900-41/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store, PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-42/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Strong Bad cordially invites you to have a giant slice of his style.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12217/288407-sbcg4ap101_metaldetector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-288407" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12217/288407-sbcg4ap101_metaldetector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-288407"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12217/288407-sbcg4ap101_metaldetector.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Strong Bad, relaxing at home with his awesomeness.</figcaption></figure>Telltale Games continues its quest to restore the relevance of traditional point-and-click adventure games through the employment of irreverent humor, as well as prove that episodic content isn't just an empty marketing promise, with Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People. Based on the just-past-their-prime animated shorts found on <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/" rel="nofollow">Homestarrunner.net (it's dot com!)</a>, Strong Bad seems to demand a little more familiarity with the source material than Telltale's <span>Sam &amp; Max</span> series did. As someone who went through a serious Strong Bad phase, I've found the initial experience to be amusing at best, and mildly pleasant at worst.<br/><br/>Like Telltale's Sam &amp; Max series, Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People will be divvied up into monthly episodes, each clocking in at a few hours. The inaugural episode, Homestar Ruiner, kicks off with Strong Bad--the braggadocious luchador-man-thing who offers senseless advice to anyone who cares to send him a poorly written email--being goaded into beating the snot out of the blithely irritating and armless Homestar Runner. The pummeling gets postponed, however, as Homestar is too busy preparing for the upcoming Free Country USA Tri-Annual Race to the End of the Race. Strong Bad instead focuses his energies on sabotaging Homestar's bid for the race's grand prize, the Silver Trophy of Ultimate Destiny, a plan that ends up having unforeseen consequences for Strong Bad.<br/><br/>Much of the comedy in Homestar Ruiner comes from silly wordplay and the varied and absurdly fabricated patois of the various characters who populate this weird Flash-based pocket dimension. Fans will appreciate appearances by nearly every supporting player in the world of Homestar Runner, from the King of Town to Homestar's ill-conceived doppelganger, Homsar. The Teen Girl Squad makes a small appearance that had the net effect of causing me to shout “fundamentals!” and then chuckle to myself for days after playing the game.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12217/288403-sbcg4ap101_camera.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-288403" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12217/288403-sbcg4ap101_camera.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-288403"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12217/288403-sbcg4ap101_camera.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Strong Bad makes Coach Z's jorb harder than it should be.</figcaption></figure>It's worth noting that the Brothers Chaps, the creative force behind Strong Bad, seem to have been pretty involved in the game's development--helping out with the writing, providing all of the appropriate voices, and penning the game's irrefutably awesome opening song. While Jeff contends that Homestar himself is maybe a touch too coherent here, I maintain that, considering the dialog-heavy nature of a point-and-click adventure game, it stays about as true to the source material as could be expected. This extends to the game's presentation, which capably translates the look of colorful 2D Flash animations into modest polygons.<br/><br/>The actual adventure gameplay in Homestar Ruiner is there largely to move the story along and service the humor. It avoids the kinds of obscure puzzles that contributed to adventure games becoming the exclusive domain of weirdly obsessive pixel-hunters. There may be a few points where it's unclear where you need to go next, but the game generally does a good job of nudging you in the right direction. This style of gameplay works just as well on the PC as it does in the WiiWare version, though given the option, the PC version is preferable--it benefits from higher resolutions, and the WiiWare version can occasionally be a little stuttery. <br/><br/>As the first episode of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, Homestar Ruiner feels fairly self-contained--you just don't get the sense that the events of this episode will really inform whatever happens next. While demand for this style of gaming and for Homestar-licensed products both peaked a while ago, it's an enjoyably goofy diversion.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20587/]]></api_detail_url><id>20587</id><name><![CDATA[Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People Episode 1: Homestar Ruiner]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episod/3030-20587/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-13 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-75178/]]></api_detail_url><id>75178</id><name><![CDATA[Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People: Episode 1 - Homestar Ruiner!]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episod/1900-42/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii Shop, PC]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-43/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Bionic Commando: Rearmed is a superb remake that should appeal to old and new fans of the NES classic.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>The downloadable services for this current generation of consoles have seen a handful of remakes of classic games. But there isn't anything out there quite like Bionic Commando: Rearmed. This remake is built from the ground up, rather than an emulation of the original with a new coat of paint. It modernizes a classic by staying true to the soul of the game, evoking the right pieces of 8-bit nostalgia in the right places, but without feeling tired or dated. In short, it's absolutely terrific.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/381385-scsh397030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-381385" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/381385-scsh397030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-381385"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12968/381385-scsh397030.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Rad sunglasses.</figcaption></figure>Of course, I say all that as someone who has probably played and finished Bionic Commando for the NES around 50 times. While I can speculate and say that I think people who didn't play the original game will probably really like it, too, I don't fit that category and won't pretend to know for sure. But other than the game having an elevated level of difficulty that some players without NES chops may find frustrating, I can't see any reason why new players wouldn't be just as psyched.</div><br/><div>The thing that always made Bionic Commando so rad was the way the grappling hook felt. You play as Nathan "Rad" Spencer, a soldier with an extending metal hook where his left arm should go. You can't jump, but you can launch your metal arm out and grab onto ceilings and other surfaces. This lets you pull yourself toward things and swing from place to place. The original BC still holds up because of how cool and skill-based the hook was. Timing your hook shots, like shooting it out to get airborne, then launching it again from mid-air to keep off the ground felt great. More importantly, it still feels great in Rearmed. While the timing of the hook seems slightly different (at least when compared with my memories of the original game), it still works.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/381394-scsh397637.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-381394" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/381394-scsh397637.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-381394"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12968/381394-scsh397637.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Rad boss fights.</figcaption></figure>The story of the game follows that of the original game. As a soldier fighting for the Federal States of America, you go in to fight off the advance of the invading Imperial army and find Super Joe, a legendary soldier who has been captured by the enemy. The Imperials are also cooking up some kind of super weapon called Albatross, and there's talk of resurrecting <a data-ref-id="3005-38" href="/adolf-hitler/3005-38" slug="adolf-hitler">some sort of evil leader from the past</a>. Surely this can't go well, and if you remember the original game, you pretty much know who the major players really are and what's going on. You probably also remember the payoff at the end of the game. It satisfies just as much here as it did in the original, if not moreso.</div><br/><div>The game is structured as an overworld map that lets you travel between levels. When you parachute into a level, you'll work your way through, taking on enemy soldiers, tanks, walls and floors that are covered in spikes, oozing slime that tries to wash you away, and more. At the end of the level, you'll typically fight a boss of some kind and earn a new item or upgrade. Some of these items give you new abilities that you'll need to proceed deeper into enemy territory. Occasionally you'll encounter enemies on the overworld map, which drops you into an overhead view styled after the original Commando. These encounters are pretty easy, but make for a nice change of pace.</div><br/><div>The graphics in Rearmed have, obviously, been completely redone. They look fantastic, too, primarily because of how colorful the game is. As you get deeper into enemy territory, you'll run into rooms with great, dramatic lighting. The game also makes enough visual references to the old game to trigger that feeling of nostalgia, but it never uses the old stuff as a crutch. The same goes for the soundtrack, which does a great job of remixing the music of the original game, as well as using the Commodore 64 version of Commando's music as inspiration for the overhead levels. I won't hear arguments on this absolutely true fact: the music in Commando on the C64 is one of the greatest pieces of game music ever produced.</div><br/><div>In addition to the main game, BCR also has a collection of challenge rooms that take the game's swinging and movement mechanics and apply them to a puzzle-like race against the clock. The time requirements can get absolutely ruthless in the later challenges, but this is still a perfect application of the game's best mechanics, and seems like the sort of thing that would make for meaningful downloadable expansions after release.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9984/377021-bcr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-377021" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.95714285714286" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:95.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9984/377021-bcr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-377021"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9984/377021-bcr.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9984/377021-bcr.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Rad Spencer.</figcaption></figure>The game also offers two-player co-op and a set of modes for up to four players. These are both fantastic ideas, and the competitive multiplayer has a lot more to it than you'd expect from a $10 downloadable game, but unfortunately the game doesn't offer online multiplayer in any of its three versions. The only online player interaction comes from leaderboards, which only appear in the console versions of the game. Your score for each area is posted online, as well as your times in each of the challenge rooms.</div><br/><div>The other differences between the platforms are minor. All three versions have some form of achievements, though the PSN version doesn't tie into the PS3's trophy system (yet). The PC version runs in a higher resolution and has fewer instances of tearing than the console versions do, but again, that's pretty minor. The PC version also lacks leaderboards and is best played with some form of analog gamepad. Also, there are a few challenge rooms that are exclusive in some versions of the game. The load times seem a little long on the Xbox 360, especially when compared to the near-instant loading I got on the PC version.</div><br/><div>Bionic Commando: Rearmed is terrific in almost every way, revitalizing a classic but long-dormant game in an exciting way that stands on its own, but also serves as a potent reminder that there's a new retail sequel on the horizon that'll bring all this crazy swinging to 3D environments.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20483/]]></api_detail_url><id>20483</id><name><![CDATA[Bionic Commando Rearmed]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/bionic-commando-rearmed/3030-20483/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-15 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72407/]]></api_detail_url><id>72407</id><name><![CDATA[Bionic Commando Rearmed]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/bionic-commando-rearmed-review/1900-43/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PC, PlayStation Network (PS3), Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-44/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[A crappy gambling game that also doubles as a parable about the dangers of downloadable content.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2405/564587-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-564587" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2405/564587-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-564587"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2405/564587-1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Forsooth, it's just as confusing as actual craps.</figcaption></figure>Fable II Pub Games is an Xbox Live Arcade game designed to give fans a head-start on their Fable II experience, and it is terrible. If this collection of imaginary gambling games is representative of the quality that can be expected from Fable II, the world of Albion is in a heap of trouble.<br/><br/>Pub Games presumes that you're already pretty jazzed up about about the pending release of Fable II, so much so that you'd be interested in playing some games of chance in order to earn some imaginary gold to spend on tabards or flagons of mead or condoms or whatever in Fable II. The games themselves are just Ren-Faire versions of familiar modern gambling games. Fortune's Tower is a blend between blackjack and solitaire, Keystone is a rejiggered version of craps, and Spinnerbox is literally just a slot machine with a different skin. If Fable II becomes a giant smash-hit, I would not be in the least bit surprised to see Fable II Spinnerbox machines in Laughlin, Nevada.<br/><br/>Played straight-up, Fable II Pub Games isn't a very good way to accrue gold. The risk/reward model is heavily slanted to the house's favor, and of the three games, Fortune's Tower is far and away the most engaging, simply because it's the only one where player input has much impact on the outcome of the game. With both Keystone and Spinnerbox, it's pure chance. A social multiplayer element might've improved Keystone, but Spinnerbox is only interesting to enthusiasts of pressing the A button. You'll unlock a few variants of these games as you play, and you can also compete in tournaments against the computer for the chance to win actual items to use in Fable II, and that's about it.<br/><br/>If that were all there was to say about Fable II Pub Games, I probably wouldn't have even bothered writing this review. Fortunately, as of this writing (nearly a week after the game's initial release) there is an incredible bug in Fortune's Tower that essentially turns it into Ye Olde ATM, making what little gameplay there was here irrelevant. I suppose we won't know the full extent of the impact this infinite-gold bug will have in the economy of Fable II until that game is on store shelves, but I can say that I'm curious to see what my ill-gotten 130,000 gold will get me.<br/><br/>So, in a sick sort of way, these Pub Games have accomplished their mission of increasing my personal investment in Fable II. Unfortunately, it has taken on a certain car-crash appeal that I'm mostly sure the developer did not intend. It's <em>slightly </em>less offensive as a Fable II preorder bonus, but it comes nowhere near justifying its 800 point ($10) asking price.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22987/]]></api_detail_url><id>22987</id><name><![CDATA[Fable II Pub Games]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/fable-ii-pub-games/3030-22987/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-18 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-75833/]]></api_detail_url><id>75833</id><name><![CDATA[Fable II Pub Games]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>1</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/fable-ii-pub-games-review/1900-44/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-45/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Too Human has a unique setting and some compelling ideas, but it doesn't offer enough variety to stay fresh from start to finish.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Do you like loot? Then Too Human might be for you. If you have an insatiable lust for items with higher stats than the ones you're currently using, or if you get giddy at the mere thought of Diablo-style rare item naming conventions, you'll probably be able to look past the game's issues and have a good time. But even at its best, it's hard to ignore Too Human's monotonous combat and dated approach to cooperative play.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2822/347016-toohuman_wp3_1680.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-347016" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2822/347016-toohuman_wp3_1680.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-347016"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2822/347016-toohuman_wp3_1680.jpg"/></a><figcaption>You play as Lord Baldur.</figcaption></figure>At least the setting is unique. The game is rooted in Norse mythology, yet it takes place in a futuristic sci-fi setting. So there are a bunch of cyber-Vikings running around. Rather than focusing on magic or sorcery, the game trades in cybernetic implants and cyberspace. You play as Baldur, one of Odin's sons. You're delivered right into the action at the beginning of the game, and flashbacks pepper the game's first area in an attempt to fill you in. They aren't terribly effective, though, as there's very little in place to set up the world itself, why it's being invaded by robots, and who is ultimately responsible. As it's a Norse tale, it doesn't take long before figures such as Thor, Heimdall, and Loki appear, and as it's tapping into the whole Viking thing, there are plenty of moments where important things like "Valhalla" and "mead" are discussed. It clashes with the game's sci-fi look here and there, but even though the events of the game are quite convoluted, it's still an interesting combination.</div><br/><div>The game itself combines inspirations from a handful of different sources, as well. Too Human is an action RPG with similarities to Diablo. You'll run through combat areas, fighting off hordes of robots or zombies, hacking and slashing all the while. You'll collect scads of loot with different status effects and statistical bonuses and attempt to collect full sets of armor for an even greater protective bonus. The game's four worlds and overall structure, however, have more of a Phantasy Star Online feel to them. Each area has enemies that do a different type of damage, allowing you to prep a different set of armor for each area, if you wish. Also, like PSO, it seems to be the intent of the developers that you grind through each area multiple times in a quest for better gear. A straight single-player run through the game took me around 12 hours and left me at level 29. The maximum level, however, is 50. Lastly, the game's combat system attempts to bring in air combos, juggles, and a mixture of swords and firearms that gives it a few check marks in the Devil May Cry column.</div><br/><div>That doesn't really mean that if you're a fan of all of Too Human's inspirations that you'll automatically love this, though. Despite attempts to work in some advanced combat options, the action in Too Human feels quite thin. There's a real lack of enemy variety, and your best viable option quickly becomes "shoot the enemies until they get close, switch to melee and start popping them up in the air with your attacks, then jump up after them to finish the job with an air combo." Regardless of the class you select, the same tactics still apply. The classes put focuses on different aspects of your character and give you a different skill tree to fill out as you gain levels. But other than the offense-focused berserker class feeling a little fragile when playing alone and the bio engineer's latent automatic healing ability, you're looking at basic shades of offensive or defensive specialization.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11799-shot_0028625.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11799" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11799-shot_0028625.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11799"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11799-shot_0028625.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The streets of Too Human are paved with loot.</figcaption></figure>There's a lot of customization that can be done to both your character and your gear. First, there's the skill tree, which is different for every class. There's also a secondary skill tree that opens up later on. You can slot weapons and armor all over your character, and the game does a good job of making a lot of the wearables look different, so it's likely that no two Baldurs will look identical. Also, the weapons and armor come in different forms. So you might find a sword that has "of rooting" on the end, which has a special ability that makes your targets immobile when it activates. You may also find weapons with empty rune slots on them. You'll find runes along the way with different bonuses, such as Total Armor +5% or Soothing +10% and so on. Fitting these runes into slots on your weapons and armor lets you further beef up any area where you feel like you're lacking, but as a rule, adding to your total armor never seems to be a bad idea.</div><br/><div>Runes also come into play with charms. Charms are items that you often find in cyberspace, and they act as little miniquests when equipped. Each charm will have a task that must be completed, such as "collect 10 blueprints" or "kill 200 undead." When you complete that task and feed the charm a specific set of runes, it activates and gives you a listed bonus, like a chance for your attacks to put enemies to sleep or the chance to add lightning to your strikes at random, and so on. While this ensures that you'll almost always have something to work on completing, even after you've finished the game numerous times, most of the charms aren't interesting enough to make repeated trips into the game's four areas much more entertaining. Also, the creatures scale up in level just as you do, so the level of challenge doesn't change much over the course of the game.</div><br/><div>The thing that's supposed to keep you coming back is the game's online cooperative play, which lets another player join you over Xbox Live. Players can trade items when connected and combining players from different classes can mix things up a little bit. For example, the bio engineer's healing abilities offset the berserker's utter lack of defense to some degree. While it may be tempting to jump right into co-op and forget that the single-player campaign even exists, you should know that none of the game's story is present when playing online. Also, all friendly AI-controlled characters don't appear at all. So you won't be fighting alongside chattery humans and you won't see them wandering around the game's town area having random conversations, either. No cutscenes, just raw combat. Considering that the game's story isn't so hot to begin with, maybe this is a decent trade-off, but this mostly makes the game feel dated--most modern story-driven co-op games have found a way to integrate some portion of the story into multiplayer play.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3111/206306-human.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-206306" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.59065420560748" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3111/206306-human.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-206306"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3111/206306-human.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3111/206306-human.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Baldur likes to stay a'head' of the competition. Sorry.</figcaption></figure>Too Human makes its four different combat areas look appropriately different, and things like up-close shots of the character models look just fine. But in action, the combat itself looks sort of bad. The game's animation feels completely canned, and there are plenty of cases where you're watching your weapons flail around, waiting for an animation to finish so you can get back in control. Little things, like the way the valkyries' legs clip through the ground when they come down to carry away dead players, or the way two-handed swords aren't actually attached to the player model when stored on your character's back make the whole game feel rough. The way the characters slide around to attack faraway targets also looks strange, as does the way air attacks let you hang in the air for a few seconds and repeatedly swing your weapon or execute a finisher, though there are at least gameplay reasons for those instances.</div><br/><div>Too Human has a real lack of enemy variety, and the first three areas of the game pit you against what seems like two types of robots, a couple types of larger robots, and perhaps some robots that are colored a bit differently to denote a special ability. On top of all that, the game's frame rate gets unstable in spots. Too Human has its moments of visual splendor, but they're few and far between. The game uses dynamic music that picks up when combat starts and quickly fades away when there's nothing actively coming at you. But the moments of non-combat are very brief, resulting in dynamic music that always seems to be starting or stopping. When you get to hear more than eight bars of it in a row, the game's music is fine.</div><br/><div>As the first part of a planned trilogy, Too Human doesn't do a particularly good job of setting things up. If anything meaningful happens in this game aside from establishing a villain, it was lost on me. The only way I got anything interesting out of it was to start searching for web pages devoted to Baldur's place in Norse mythology to see how many liberties Silicon Knights is taking with its fiction and to see what sorts of things could lie ahead in the next games. As a game, the action is a little too straightforward for its own good. The latent loot fiend in me had fun uncovering new items, slotting runes, and finding blueprints for new items--but even that stuff doesn't feel as fleshed out as you'd probably expect. In short, large parts of Too Human feel like they were designed to the standards of the last generation of consoles, not this one.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20499/]]></api_detail_url><id>20499</id><name><![CDATA[Too Human]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/too-human/3030-20499/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-18 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72427/]]></api_detail_url><id>72427</id><name><![CDATA[Too Human]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/too-human-review/1900-45/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-46/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[This click-happy sci-fi dungeon crawler is neither aggressively bad nor especially remarkable.

It has all the earmarks. It's played from a top-down perspective. It sends you crawling through endless same-looking dungeons (sci-fi spaceship dungeons, anyway). It has you clicking to move, clicking to attack, clicking to...well, do just about anything. In the grand tradition of games like <a data-ref-id="3030-20803" href="/diablo-iii/3030-20803" slug="diablo-iii">Diablo</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-8638" href="/titan-quest/3030-8638" slug="titan-quest">Titan Quest</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3030-3958" href="/nox/3030-3958" slug="nox">Nox</a>, you'd expect--and more importantly, <em>want</em>--every downed enemy in Space Siege to dispense some kind of Fearless Laser Rifle of the Vanguard, or something. <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">But the game is more simplistic than that. Enemies don't drop specific loot-style items. Instead, they all bleed a generic form of currency called upgrade parts that you can cash in at a workbench (basically a vendor station) located next to each save point. This is where you access basic common character upgrades like health, crit chance, armor rate, attack speed, and so on. You don't earn experience points and gain levels like in a traditional RPG, so this is the only way to advance your character's basic attributes.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">In lieu of ubiquitous, scrumptious loot, there are only 10 fixed weapons that are parceled out to you at set points in the storyline, and you can use upgrade points to further improve the stats on these. Strangely, the weapons don't always become more powerful in the order you acquire them. More than once I picked up a new weapon to find it actually had worse stats than the one I was already using, even after upgrades, so I just stuck with the old one. But these games are all about finding shiny new toys and laying waste with them, so only getting to use about half the weapons for any real length of time was unsatisfying.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">There's also a skill tree with only two paths--combat and engineering--and you're free to pick and choose skills between the two as you go. Again, you only get a specific number of skill points at predetermined places in the story, so you can't really dabble in both trees if you want to specialize in the better skills at the end of either of them.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1860/376167-spacesiege_2008_07_29_20_28_27_19.png" data-ref-id="1300-376167" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1860/376167-spacesiege_2008_07_29_20_28_27_19.png" data-ref-id="1300-376167"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1860/376167-spacesiege_2008_07_29_20_28_27_19.png"/></a><figcaption>There's just not much depth in the role-playing here.</figcaption></figure><p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">With no classes, such limited customization options, and the total absence of delicious loots, the character-building in Space Siege ended up feeling shallower than I would have liked. The game also got way too easy by the end. Since I'd maxed out my dude and weapons with my surplus of points, and gained a number of overly powerful abilities, I dominated the last few bosses and breezed through to the ending unopposed.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">The game's premise isn't bad. A couple of centuries hence, humanity's spacefaring has stepped on the toes of a crab-like alien race called the Kerak. Taking great offense, they've come to eradicate our species and destroy Earth. You're a soldier on the lone colony ship to escape the Kerak's brutal invasion, but you wake up from a few weeks in cryosleep to find that a single enemy pod has breached your ship's hull and flooded its interior with aliens. Now you need to kill them all, and deal with any other "surprise" opponents thrown your way over the course of the game as well. (Hint: the appearance of those other opponents isn't a huge surprise.)</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">The story moves along at a brisk enough pace, but it also uses some similar plot devices as--and in a couple of cases, blatantly lifts identical plot points from--games like <a data-ref-id="3030-4800" href="/fear-first-encounter-assault-recon/3030-4800" slug="fear-first-encounter-assault-recon">F.E.A.R.</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-8870" href="/system-shock-2/3030-8870" slug="system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3030-14537" href="/doom-3/3030-14537" slug="doom-3">Doom 3</a>, which ultimately made me feel like I'd seen most of this before. The endgame is also disjointedly paced and leads to a rather abrupt, unsatisfying climax.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">Coincidentally, Space Siege does share one aspect with Too Human: the ability to make use of performance-enhancing cybernetic upgrades that come with a vague warning about the questionable wisdom of sacrificing one's humanity to become a raging badass. These warnings don't translate into alternate gameplay incentives, though. The cyborg replacements for your arm, legs, chest, spine, eye and even brain all come with significant combat bonuses that are hard to resist, and the game doesn't really give you a reason <em>to</em> resist them, other than exactly two skills on the tree that require you to be almost fully human. (Compare those meager two to at least a dozen useful skills that demand you <em>do</em> take the upgrades.) There are three endings in the game based mostly on whether or not you want to install all the cyborg gear, but they're all equally short and lousy and in no way justify missing out on those buffs and skills. I ended up using every cyborg upgrade without blinking.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106812-s_s_shawngr3-ls01gx_2007_12_05_12_13_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106812" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/106812-s_s_shawngr3-ls01gx_2007_12_05_12_13_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-106812"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/106812-s_s_shawngr3-ls01gx_2007_12_05_12_13_10.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/106812-s_s_shawngr3-ls01gx_2007_12_05_12_13_10.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The only good bug is a dead bug.</figcaption></figure> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">There are a couple of neat aspects worth mentioning. Early on you pick up a capable combat robot called HR-V (read: Harvey) that you can control almost as extensively as you can your own character. HR-V gets its own skills and commands, so you're practically controlling two characters at the same time, and the scrappy little bot can get you out of a tight spot occasionally. He's just as good at getting himself killed, though. Also, somebody left tons of explosive barrels and canisters lying all around your ship, and the game has a nice physics model that sends objects flying every which way when you cause a lot of explosions with these. I stopped a few times just to blow up a room full of boxes even after all the enemies were dead.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">Space Siege is genuinely fun for a while, but at some point in the dozen-or-so-hour campaign it became more tedious than entertaining, and I just wished there was more depth in the mechanics to hold my interest. A couple of glaring omissions didn't help matters, such as cooperative play integrated into the campaign (it's instead relegated to a series of unrelated one-off missions, launched from a really clumsy external application, that don't really go anywhere) and the ability to remap your controls <em>at all</em>, which, just...well, that speaks for itself. With quality dungeon crawlers like Titan Quest now going for bargain-bin prices, and Diablo III threatening to redefine this specific genre in the relatively near future, Space Siege is hard to recommend at its full asking price, but it's entertaining enough for hardcore fans of this kind of game, if you can find it at a reasonable discount. </p>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20612/]]></api_detail_url><id>20612</id><name><![CDATA[Space Siege]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/space-siege/3030-20612/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-21 14:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73863/]]></api_detail_url><id>73863</id><name><![CDATA[Space Siege]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Brad]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/space-siege-review/1900-46/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PC]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-47/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[1942: Joint Strike is a decent shooter that offers some replay value--but only if you're into moving up online leaderboards.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Is it just me, or did someone at Capcom wake up earlier this year ago and say "hey, wait, don't we own the rights to a bunch of great arcade games? Let's start remaking them!" In my mind, that's the only possible explanation for the attention Capcom's been paying to its back catalog lately. 1942: Joint Strike is an all-new vertically scrolling shooter that operates in much the same fashion as the previous games in the 1942 line.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3718/250612-untitled_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-250612" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56332453825858" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3718/250612-untitled_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-250612"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3718/250612-untitled_10.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Joint Strikes are an interesting way to work cooperatively.</figcaption></figure>The big difference in Joint Strike is that you're not playing this on some vertically oriented arcade monitor. You're (ideally) playing it on a widescreen TV. Rather than stick to the classic presentation, Joint Strike fills the width of the screen. It's a little weird at first blush, as you don't really see as far in front of your plane as you might have in the previous games. But since this game was built this way from the ground up, it isn't really a problem.</div><br/><div>The game has you moving through five different levels of World War II-tinged shooter action, each ending with a boss fight against some hideously oversized mechanical monstrosity, like a giant tank with a ton of turrets, or a giant boat with a ton of turrets, or maybe a giant plane with a ton of turrets. In addition to your base weapon, you can also drop a limited number of bombs and fire a limited number of missiles. You can also switch out your weak starting weapon by collecting power-ups that can give you a spread shot, a laser that blasts through multiple targets, and so on.</div><br/><div>1942: Joint Strike is at its best when playing with another person. You can do that locally or online, but however you do it, it's better when you can communicate with the other player. That's so you can properly coordinate your Joint Strike attack, which sends a blast from one plane to the other, damaging everything in-between. It's an interesting attack that requires both players to work together for proper positioning.</div><br/><div>Five levels might not sound like much in the way of game length, and you're right, it's not a very long game. There's maybe 30 minutes of content here, but it's stretched out by the game's stubborn refusal to let you continue from where you left off. You'll start out with a set number of lives based on your difficulty setting and high scores can earn you some more, but if you run out, you'll have to start over from the beginning.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3718/250587-untitled_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-250587" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56332453825858" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3718/250587-untitled_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-250587"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3718/250587-untitled_2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>It's in your best interest to dodge whenever fire is heading in your direction.</figcaption></figure>While it isn't a terribly long game, at least there's a sense of variety to it. The formations of incoming planes change up well enough to keep you guessing, and taking on various ground- or sea-based enemies also keeps things fresh for at least one full playthrough. Once you've seen it all, it's time to start working on your score. The game is very multiplier-focused, and the multiplier you get for a kill depends on how close you are to your targets when they go down. So if you're right up in the grills of the opposition, you can earn up to 16 times the normal rate per kill. This, as you might expect, requires a bit more skill and finesse than just hanging back and blasting everyone from a distance, offering a decent risk vs. reward scenario for people who obsess over leaderboards.</div><br/><div>All in all, 1942: Joint Strike is a good, solid scrolling shooter. It's tough, but not so tough that it will only appeal to genre crazies who can only feel emotion when it's filtered through a bullet hell pattern. In fact, I have a feeling that staunch advocates of the shoot-'em-up may find this game to be a little too basic for their tastes. But if you're somewhere in the middle--perhaps an old 1942 fan who wants a decent nostalgia bump, Joint Strike fits the bill quite nicely.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20472/]]></api_detail_url><id>20472</id><name><![CDATA[1942: Joint Strike]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/1942-joint-strike/3030-20472/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-20 14:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72387/]]></api_detail_url><id>72387</id><name><![CDATA[1942: Joint Strike]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/1942-joint-strike-review/1900-47/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store, PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-48/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Galaga Legions isn't a great Galaga sequel, but it's a decent space shooter with some interesting ideas.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div>Galaga Legions is a pretty interesting update to the old static-screen space shooter equation. Rather than deal in waves that contain set numbers of enemies, Legions constantly bombards you with tons of enemy ships and, at times, feels as frantic as a dual-joystick shooter. But my key issue with it is that it really doesn't feel very much like <a data-ref-id="3030-15784" href="/galaga/3030-15784" slug="galaga">Galaga</a> at all.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2739/593436-capture74.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-593436" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2739/593436-capture74.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-593436"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2739/593436-capture74.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Legions is usually pretty hectic.</figcaption></figure>The core concept is definitely Galaga-like. It's as if someone sat down and decided to make an entire game out of the "challenging stage" bonus rounds found in the original Galaga. But rather than shooting for accuracy and trying to hit everything, as you did in the '80s, Legions doesn't seem to care if you hit everything or not. It's more about surviving the looping and swooping ships that are constantly flying into and out of the screen.</div><br/><div>You'll fight off the enemy by shooting them, naturally. Your ship can only fire up, as normal, but you can move around the screen at will. You also have two satellite cannons that can be deployed at any time using the right stick. Unlike your main ship, the satellites can fire up, down, left, or right depending on which direction you push. You can pick up your satellites by touching them, or a tap of the left bumper will send them back to you. Immediately before ships fly onto the screen, a set of streaky lines details the path of the incoming ships, giving you a moment to set up your satellites and prepare for the attack. The enemies rarely shoot at you, so you're mainly trying to avoid collisions while racking up as high of a score as you can. Eliminating enemies in quick succession, or hitting an explosive ship that takes out all the other enemies in that wave, brings your score multiplier up. It drains very quickly, though, so it doesn't seem like it's one of those action puzzle games where you can do some kind of full combo the whole way through.</div><br/><div>Galaga's other defining feature was the way the boss ships would come down and spit out a tractor beam, capturing one of your ships. You could then free your captured ship and dock it with your new one, giving you double firepower. But Galaga Legions instead bases its capturing mechanic off of <a data-ref-id="3030-18690" href="/galaga-3/3030-18690" slug="galaga-3">Gaplus</a> (Galaga's direct sequel), where you could capture enemy ships and use them for additional firepower. In Legions, this is accomplished using a big black hole-like ball that appears at a set point in every level. When you shoot it enough times, it activates, sucks up all the ships on screen, and gives them to you to control. The enemy ships deploy with your satellites, making them much more powerful.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3718/249632-untitled_12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-249632" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56332453825858" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3718/249632-untitled_12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-249632"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3718/249632-untitled_12.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Dodging all this stuff is actually a lot easier than it initially looks.</figcaption></figure>The background graphics are probably the best thing about Galaga Legions. It goes from being a pretty standard star field to a warping mess of colorful streaks and back again over the course of its five stages. The flashy look definitely makes the game feel more action-packed than it really is. Also, you can unlock additional skins for the various ships, including ships modeled off of original graphics for Galaga, Galaxian, and so on. The old graphics used in these skins have borders around them that make them stand out in the same way that <a data-ref-id="3030-19552" href="/pac-man-championship-edition/3030-19552" slug="pac-man-championship-edition">Pac-Man Championship Edition</a> did. Incidentally, Galaga Legions was made by some of the same people that did Pac-Man CE, but the approach to updating an old game is so vastly different in the two games that there's very little common ground between them.</div><br/><div>As a game following in the footsteps of the Galaga legacy, Legions doesn't do a very good job. Other than the ability for ships to capture other ships, nothing about this game feels much like the original game. So it might not do anything for people with an eye for nostalgia. But on its own, Galaga Legions manages to be an interesting and unique take on static-screen shooters. The demo provides a pretty complete picture of what the full game is like, so if that excites you at all, chances are you'll find the full game to be just as satisfying.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21093/]]></api_detail_url><id>21093</id><name><![CDATA[Galaga Legions]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/galaga-legions/3030-21093/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-25 11:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-77726/]]></api_detail_url><id>77726</id><name><![CDATA[Galaga Legions]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/galaga-legions-review/1900-48/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-49/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Ratchet & Clank: Quest for Booty is a decent diversion for the price, but will make you long for the next full installment in the series. ]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p>Man, I really hope you like pirates and robots, because Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Quest for Booty is, if nothing else, a vehicle for as much campy robot-pirate humor as a downloadable title can hold. Much like your Ikea bookshelf, you'll find that Quest for Booty looks great for the price, but doesn't really contain the love and craftsmanship of its higher-priced counterparts.<br/><br/>Quest for Booty begins soon after the events of <a data-ref-id="3030-15212" href="/ratchet-clank-future-tools-of-destruction/3030-15212" slug="ratchet-clank-future-tools-of-destruction">Tools of Destruction</a>, the previous PlayStation 3 installment of the series. <a data-ref-id="3005-323" href="/clank/3005-323" slug="clank">Clank</a> has been not-so-forcibly kidnapped by the <span>Zoni</span>, a mysterious race of robot that have some kind of greater plan for our little, metallic friend. This basically sets the scene for Quest for Booty, as Ratchet and his ladyfriend, <span>Talwyn</span>, search for clues regarding Clank's whereabouts and dig a little deeper into this whole Zoni situation. Along the way you'll encounter some old pirate acquaintances, some new pirate masterminds, pirate ghosts, pirate ships, bats, and pirates. Also? Pirates.<br/><br/>While this sounds all well and good, the story in Quest for Booty does little to flesh out the universe. Players that didn't make it through Tools of Destruction will be dropped into a world full of undeveloped characters and a plot that seems to revolve more around setting up campy pirate jokes than continuing the story arc from the previous game. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Tools of Destruction, I found much of the charm to be missing and the whole experience to be a little hollow. <br/><br/></p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3725/218307-ratchet_and_clank_future.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-218307" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3725/218307-ratchet_and_clank_future.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-218307"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3725/218307-ratchet_and_clank_future.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Did we mention there are pirates?</figcaption></figure>For me, the Ratchet &amp; Clank series has always been about platforming, exploring, and powering-up your collection of weapons. While Quest for Booty certainly delivers on the platforming, the other two elements come up a bit short. There are really no incentives to explore the somewhat limited areas of the game, save for the few weapon upgrades hidden throughout. There are no golden bolts or collectibles to find, which is probably for the best, since this is strictly a linear affair and you won't be able to travel to previous locations at will. Finding enough bolts, Ratchet &amp; Clank's currency, to buy the couple of items you're presented with is also a non-issue and doesn't require anything more than tearing into the crates and baddies presented along the course of the game.<br/><br/>With subtitles like Up Your Arsenal, Going Commando and Tools of Destruction, the Ratchet series has a pretty well-established reputation for delivering the goods when it comes to weaponry. Quest for Booty eschews the gun collecting and instead, in true <a data-ref-id="3015-57" href="/abilitease/3015-57" slug="abilitease">abilitease</a> fashion, starts you off with a set number of guns that you subsequently lose and then recover throughout the course of the game. This strips away an essential layer of the gameplay, leaving only the sticky residue of a half-hearted weapon powering-up mechanic. With enough use, each weapon will increase in power, up to a maximum level of five. Considering that each gun already starts on level three, the gun leveling doesn't require much effort. On top of that, you'll be hard-pressed to find a real need to use more than two or three items from your limited arsenal. Finally, as if to make the entire process even less meaningful, you'll keep the weapon's earned experience when you die. This is standard for the series, but the new levels come so quickly that you don't really get a sense of accomplishment when you've finally maxed out your weapons.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15356/445015-2720390911_8e9e2b42b5_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-445015" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15356/445015-2720390911_8e9e2b42b5_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-445015"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15356/445015-2720390911_8e9e2b42b5_b.jpg"/></a><figcaption>This is one good-looking downloadable game.</figcaption></figure>Making your way through the levels mostly involves either basic platforming or some confined combat situations. Everything is pretty solid, but I didn't encounter anything that made me feel like I was the prince of the <a data-ref-id="3015-1" href="/double-jump/3015-1" slug="double-jump">double jump </a>either. I didn't really feel a sense of danger or tension, except for the grind rail portions, which offer the most thrilling sequences in the relatively short experience. You'll also discover that your wrench has now mysteriously been upgraded to include the ability to remotely tether items and manipulate them. Many of the platforming puzzles throughout the game make good use of this new mechanic, and it's something that I hope to see more of in future iterations of the series.<br/><br/>The presentation is amazing for a downloadable title. The graphics, voice acting and animation are all comparable to its big-budget brother. You won't be overwhelmed with the variety in the enemies and environments, but what you do encounter looks great and seems to fit very nicely into the universe. The music is probably the only thing about the package that seems to not measure up, and it can get somewhat repetitive. Imagine taking a road trip with a guy who can only remember the first five bars to the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> theme song. I was also hoping for a few more cutscenes, but considering the abbreviated length of the game, I can't really find fault in their absence. <br/><br/>I guess Quest for Booty just feels like the <em>Aladdin 2</em> of Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction. It has all the same elements as the original, but it just doesn't deliver the charm and appeal. Of course, it is an intentionally shorter game at a markedly lower price, so it's not unexpected that some compromises would have to be made. In the end, Ratchet and Clank Future: Quest for Booty delivers a quarter of a game at a quarter of the price, and ultimately, you're only getting a quarter of the entertainment.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21115/]]></api_detail_url><id>21115</id><name><![CDATA[Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ratchet-clank-future-quest-for-booty/3030-21115/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-08-25 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73878/]]></api_detail_url><id>73878</id><name><![CDATA[Ratchet and Clank Future: Quest for Booty]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Vinny]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/ratchet-clank-future-quest-for-booty-review/1900-49/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-50/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[There are just enough new features--and just enough delightfully nutty new pinatas--to warrant a second trip into the garden.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p>It was hard to go into <a data-ref-id="3030-20682" href="/viva-pinata-trouble-in-paradise/3030-20682" slug="viva-pinata-trouble-in-paradise">Viva Pinata: Trouble in Paradise</a> and look at it as a fully new game. This sequel to Rare's bizarrely cute and addictive <a data-ref-id="3030-2168" href="/viva-pinata/3030-2168" slug="viva-pinata">2006 gardening management sim</a> reuses a heaping pile of content from its predecessor, including art assets, music, voiceovers, menu designs, and every single pinata from the original. For the first few hours, Trouble in Paradise felt more like an expansion pack than a real sequel.<br/><br/></p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/272711-viva2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272711" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/272711-viva2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272711"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2788/272711-viva2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The interface improvements make this sequel a lot easier to play.</figcaption></figure>But the more I dug into the game, the more clever new pinatas I discovered and tamed, and the more compelling and, in some cases, <em>necessary</em> new gameplay features I uncovered. This is definitely more of the same, but there's enough fresh content in here that Trouble in Paradise quickly stoked anew the fires of my weird abiding pinata love.<br/><br/>All the familiar, lovable pinatas from the first game are back, and they all behave pretty much exactly the same. You'll spend just as much time trying to keep your kittyfloss from eating your mousemallows, or setting a taffly on fire and then putting it out with a watering can to evolve it into a more valuable redhott. I would have been put off by all these blatant similarities if the game didn't also do a good job of trotting out the new species, starting with the very first ladybug-like bispotti and continuing on through the tigermisu and other totally crazy larger animals.<br/><br/>Lots of the new pinatas won't show up on the fringes of your own garden. Instead, they live in the far-flung wilderness, in the icy Pinarctic and the arid Dessert Desert. You can travel to those places and drop some baited traps to retrieve new pinatas like the pengum, vulchurro, sweetle, and robean. There's not much else to do in the wilds besides enjoy the change of scenery, but since you have to entice these captured pinatas to stay after you nab them, you can also now lay down sand and snow in your own garden. Those new terrain types will later attract even more advanced regional pinatas, like the walrusk.<br/><br/>The last game forced you to hit the A button through numerous menus--and almost as many loading screens--every time you wanted to buy anything for your garden. That's OK once in a while when you want to add an uncommon object like a glow rock to spruce up your surroundings, but when you have to plow through the menu pile every time you need to plant a seed or fertilize a sapling--which you do about every five minutes--it gets old, fast.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/272715-viva4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272715" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/272715-viva4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272715"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2788/272715-viva4.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Find some wild new species in the desert and arctic areas.</figcaption></figure>Luckily, Trouble in Paradise has a new context-sensitive pop-up menu that lets you buy seeds, fertilizer, and other common objects without shoving any loading screens or full-screen menus in your face. That makes the gameplay a lot more efficient and pleasant to deal with over the course of the numerous hours you will inevitably play this game, because it's awesome.<br/><br/>Trouble in Paradise turns gardening into a social affair with a four-player mode you can run on Xbox Live or on the same couch. When other gardeners join your game, you can set the level of access they have to your stuff, so you can prevent them from selling your precious rare pinatas or digging a bunch of mud holes everywhere, if you want.<br/><br/>Guest players build up experience and money that go straight back into their own solo gardens, so the multiplayer experience is meaningful and rewarding for everyone. Like its predecessor, the game can get a little hectic at times with so much going on at once, so it can be useful to have an assistant or two to help you focus on a particular task. (I ran into some trouble when a higher-level player joined my low-level garden and brought a bunch of nasty sour pinatas with him, but quitting the multiplayer game and restarting it seemed to restore my garden to its former peaceful splendor.)<br/><br/>Viva Pinata might look like a kiddy game, but the management gameplay is surprisingly complex and hectic. That might have turned off casual players last time around, so Rare has included a "Just for Fun" mode here that relaxes the rules of pinata attraction and gives you unlimited money. I don't have much use for this mode because half the reason I play Viva Pinata is for the the rewarding feeling of meticulously setting up my garden's flora and terrain to entice new pinatas into staying there. But it's a nice feature for those who want to just mess around in a really pretty garden without feeling a lot of pressure or reading a daunting list of pinata resident requirements.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/272716-viva7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272716" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/272716-viva7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272716"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2788/272716-viva7.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2788/272716-viva7.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>It's OK to like Viva Pinata. Honest.</figcaption></figure>Strangely, the new Pinata Vision feature negates some of that reward if you let it run away with your self-control. You can take in-game pictures of your pinatas and items and then upload those to the game's web site, where they're converted into downloadable trading card images that contain bar codes you can scan back into someone else's game with the Xbox Live Vision camera.<br/><br/>This is a nice idea in theory, when the game isn't being picky about the lighting conditions, camera focus, and distance while you're trying to scan the image. But it can also make the game way too easy. Even before release, there were a number of advanced pinata cards floating around the Internet that gave me a silly amount of experience and money just by scanning them into my game. Nobody's making you use the cards, of course, but once the game is out for a couple of weeks and you can find cards for every top pinata online, it'll be really easy to cheese your way to a top level just by dropping cards in. At least the game makes some effort to curtail your use of cards in various situations, but I still ended up with a number of valuable species that seemed way beyond my level.<br/><br/>Trouble in Paradise offers everything the first game did--literally--with a heap of new content and enough streamlined gameplay mechanics to get even an experienced gardener's green thumb back into action. And if you never tried the original game, first of all, shame on you. Second, go play this one. The reasonable $40 price tag only sweetens the deal on this vastly improved version of one of the Xbox 360's most unique and endearing games.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20682/]]></api_detail_url><id>20682</id><name><![CDATA[Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/viva-pinata-trouble-in-paradise/3030-20682/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-03 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72733/]]></api_detail_url><id>72733</id><name><![CDATA[Viva Pinata: Trouble in Paradise]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Brad]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/viva-pinata-trouble-in-paradise-review/1900-50/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-51/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Technical hiccups can't keep The Behemoth from sieging my heart!]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15471/420530-ccbg6_border.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-420530" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.47888888888889" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:47.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15471/420530-ccbg6_border.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-420530"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15471/420530-ccbg6_border.jpg"/></a><figcaption>I'm not even going to try and explain what's going on here.</figcaption></figure>While there will always be plenty of room in video games for nostalgia, creating something brand-new that tickles those same sense-memories is a challenging proposition. There's plenty of familiar stuff in The Behemoth's Castle Crashers, a game that owes as much to <a data-ref-id="3030-8594" href="/gauntlet/3030-8594" slug="gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> as it does to <a data-ref-id="3030-6722" href="/final-fight/3030-6722" slug="final-fight">Final Fight</a>, but it works because it doesn't lean on lazy “hey, remember?” references. Instead of pandering with faux-8-bit graphics and repetitive button-mashing gameplay, Castle Crashers delivers an art style that is crude and playful in its own way, and button-mashing gameplay that rewards progress and evolves just enough to keep you engaged. The only things really holding Castle Crashers back are some unfortunate technical problems, but they're not enough to entirely suppress the game's gleeful abandon for both hacking <em>and</em> slashing.<br/><br/>The setup is straightforward enough, with players taking on the role of one of four Crayola-colored knights slicing their way through armies of goblins, demons, skeletons, and the occasional screen-filling boss monster to recover a bunch of princesses and a gigantic magical stone from an evil wizard. What keeps it all from being some tired-ass <a data-ref-id="3025-167" href="/dungeons-dragons/3025-167" slug="dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> knock-off is the colorful art of The Behemoth's <a data-ref-id="3040-57659" href="/dan-paladin/3040-57659" slug="dan-paladin">Dan Paladin</a> and an absurd and unapologetically puerile sense of humor. Oversized treasure chests fall from the sky accompanied by cheesy techno, terrified deer rocket across the screen from the sheer force of their uncontrollable bowel movements, and when little yellow aliens show up halfway through the game, it's pleasantly unsurprising. The ending alone, which reminded me of <a data-ref-id="3030-16647" href="/amped-3/3030-16647" slug="amped-3">Amped 3</a> in a free-association kind of way, is worth playing through the game to see.<br/><br/>As much theoretical fondness as there is for old-school beat-'em-ups, there's a reason those games fell out of favor--hitting one button for hours on end is straight-up boring. There's an inherent repetition to Castle Crashers, but the game mitigates this problem in a number of clever ways. In addition to the two basic attack buttons that can be strung together into multi-hit combos, each knight has its own elemental magic attack to blast enemies with. Figuring out the right attacks for the different enemies keeps things interesting, and you can do lots of crazy air-juggle moves which, when executed correctly, allow you to take out a number of enemies without touching the ground. <br/><br/>Though you can carry up to five health potions, the game only allows you one life per level, and there are definitely encounters that you'll be lucky to walk away from on your first try. While this could've been a recipe for massive frustration, there's a light RPG element that balances out the difficulty, rewarding you with new attacks and the ability to customize the strength, magic, defense, and agility of your knight. You can also revisit levels that you've already played, so if you're having trouble getting through a certain section, you can fall back and grind a few levels out on an earlier stage. <br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1205/255847-wp2_1024x768.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255847" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1205/255847-wp2_1024x768.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255847"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1205/255847-wp2_1024x768.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Color Me Badd.</figcaption></figure>You'll find weapons on enemies and in stores that confer various combat bonuses, as well as animal orbs--essentially plushy animals whose effects range from increasing how fast you gain experience to helping you find secret items in the environment. Their effect on the actual gameplay isn't overly obvious, but I really appreciate the way they just indifferently float along behind you as you wreak mayhem. These features let the game go on for longer than you might expect from an arcade-style game like this, and it took me a good five or six hours to get to the end credits.<br/><br/>Any progress you make works seamlessly between the single- and multiplayer modes in Castle Crashers, though unfortunately, the online mode barely works at all, with rampant disconnects being a major problem. I also found that when playing with the full four players, Castle Crashers can be a bit too chaotic for its own good, and it ended up obscuring much of the complexity I enjoyed in the single-player game. The multiplayer isn't inherently bad, but I definitely found there to be diminishing returns as more players were added.<br/><br/>There's also a well-known bug in Castle Crashers that can annihilate any of your character progress, something I experienced firsthand. The Behemoth has stated that a title update is forthcoming, though a date hasn't yet been given, so until then, buyer beware. Despite these problems, and the game's higher-than-average $15 price tag, I thoroughly enjoyed Castle Crashers, though they also keep me from recommending the game as wholeheartedly as I'd like to.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20733/]]></api_detail_url><id>20733</id><name><![CDATA[Castle Crashers]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/castle-crashers/3030-20733/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-03 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72536/]]></api_detail_url><id>72536</id><name><![CDATA[Castle Crashers]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/castle-crashers-review/1900-51/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-52/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[The Last Guy is an interesting game, but there's not enough to it to make it a good game.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1040/416203-lastguy1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-416203" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1040/416203-lastguy1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-416203"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1040/416203-lastguy1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Getting survivors to the escape zone is your only goal.</figcaption></figure>The Last Guy is a fascinating game that exemplifies Sony's dedication to the sort of left-of-center downloadable releases that you just don't see anywhere else.

Your task is to collect surviving humans and return them to a safe zone. You must collect a set number in a set amount of time to complete each level. The humans themselves are hiding out in buildings, so you'll need to run near the entrance of each building to get them to come out and join your parade of survivors.</div><br/><div>Why are they hiding? <em>Zombies.</em> It seems that a big purple ray was fired at the Earth, turning everyone who was outside into some sort of horrific creature. The zombies will spook your survivors and send them scattering back into nearby buildings if your line collides with a bad guy. You'll also have to deal with multiple types of evildoers. The normal zombie shambles around slowly, picking up the pace in your direction if he sees you, but his eyesight isn't so great. You'll also deal with giant bugs that scurry around the roads, other giant bugs that creep in your direction if they spot you, a big zombie who shouts every so often, spooking humans back into hiding, and so on. This makes each level a little different, but they all come down to finding a path through the level and, above all, hurrying. You have a couple of moves to assist you, including the ability to sprint and the ability to bring up the rear and gather your crowd into a huddle, which is handy if some of them are standing directly in harm's way.</div><br/><div>There are a few pick-ups, named VIP citizens that give you a bonus when collected, and a handful of extra levels that you can see if you do really well on the regular ones, but that's roughly it. The game tabulates your score after a successful run and uploads it to an online leaderboard, and you either move on or try again for a better score. It's not bad, but after around three levels of this, I was more than ready to move on.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/586762-thelastguy10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-586762" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/586762-thelastguy10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-586762"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1570/586762-thelastguy10.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Save dudes, dodge zombies.</figcaption></figure>The game has a rare sense of style to it that makes you quickly realize that the developers were probably cracking each other up the entire time they were making the game. But sadly, most of the coolest things about The Last Guy don't actually exist in the game itself. Prior to its release, Sony posted a tool that would let you turn any website into a little Flash version of The Last Guy. That sort of custom, on-the-fly level generation would totally save the full game--being able to generate levels out of any Google Maps image or something like that would have been a very cool gimmick. The other is a wild interview with a group of guys who pretend to be the game's developers while talking up the importance of curry and math and have a goat in their office. If the full game had more of that spirit in it, it'd be a much better game, overall. Instead, it gets by with its deliberately retro look and feel, which works reasonably well but can't carry the overall package.</div><br/><div>While you could say that there's nothing quite like The Last Guy--well, beyond the <a data-ref-id="3030-15646" href="/wtf-work-time-fun/3030-15646" slug="wtf-work-time-fun">Work Time Fun</a> minigame that the whole thing was based on--its unique feel doesn't make it a great purchase at $9.99. If you're really interested in the quirky sort of stuff that Sony's been occasionally putting out on the PlayStation Network, you'll probably get a kick out of this. But you'll probably get that same kick out of the game's free, one-level demo. Go with that first.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21513/]]></api_detail_url><id>21513</id><name><![CDATA[The Last Guy]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-last-guy/3030-21513/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-03 22:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-74810/]]></api_detail_url><id>74810</id><name><![CDATA[The Last Guy]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-last-guy-review/1900-52/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-53/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[The awesome destructive potential of Mercs 2 is hamstrung by a litany of technical shortcomings and clunky design.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9323/598311-mercenaries2jan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-598311" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56289308176101" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9323/598311-mercenaries2jan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-598311"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9323/598311-mercenaries2jan.jpg"/></a><figcaption>From the Venezuela Tourism Board brochure.</figcaption></figure>The original <a data-ref-id="3030-7633" href="/mercenaries-playground-of-destruction/3030-7633" slug="mercenaries-playground-of-destruction">Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction</a> was a pleasant surprise for me. It managed to take the GTA open-world format to a tongue-in-cheek, ripped-from-the-headlines military theater that was essentially an international buffet of stuff to blow up. Mercenaries 2: World in Flames changes the theater from a fictionalized <a data-ref-id="3035-418" href="/north-korea/3035-418" slug="north-korea">North Korea</a> to a fictionalized <a data-ref-id="3035-134" href="/venezuela/3035-134" slug="venezuela">Venezuela</a>, but the basic idea is pretty much the same. With the added power of current-gen consoles, this should be more than enough for a good time, but sadly, there's a bevy of design and technical problems that keep Mercs 2 from being all that it could be.<br/><br/>While your motivation in Playground of Destruction was strictly financial, it's been spiked with a little revenge this time around after your character gets double-crossed and shot in the ass (an event that the game considers funny enough to harp on for the rest of the game) by the newly anointed dictator of Venezuela. You'll spend the rest of the game working with the different factions in Venezuela--oil companies, rebels, pirates, American military, and Chinese military--to bring down the new regime. Of course, most of these factions have contradictory interests, so more often than not, performing a mission for one will decrease your standing with another. It's a fine idea, if not a particularly new one, but it doesn't always seem to work as advertised, and on a few occasions I found myself hated by everyone, forcing me to pony up a few million dollars in bribe money just to access one of the main story missions.<br/><br/>Your missions will almost always involve traveling to a location, blowing something up, and/or taking out a specific target. The game is at its best when the objectives are simple and straightforward, which is thankfully most of the time. When the game tries to get clever with the mission structures, I often found that I'd end up failing through no apparent fault of my own. For a game that is ostensibly a shooter, the actual shooting in Mercs 2 feels terribly inaccurate, to the point that it's often faster and more practical to just run up to enemies and take them out with a quick melee attack. You can pick up weapons from fallen enemies, and hijack just about any vehicle you see, though anything fun like a tank or helicopter requires you to play out a lengthy and eventually tedious hijacking minigame. Still, most of the time your best gear will come from air-drops that you can call in from the battlefield.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/617668-mer2_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-617668" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56223776223776" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/617668-mer2_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-617668"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15434/617668-mer2_03.jpg"/></a><figcaption>These hijacking sequences get old fast.</figcaption></figure>The most devastating weapons in your arsenal are air strikes, which come in a delicious variety of flavors, and are highly effective for knocking down buildings and clearing out swaths of enemies. One of the fundamental problems with Mercenaries 2 is the whole process of deploying air strikes, vehicles, and weapon load outs. First you have to travel to a faction-specific location to actually purchase your goods, then pause the game and assign the desired drop to a three-slotted context menu. Once you're back in the action, you have to thumb through the context menu using the d-pad to select the drop you want. If it's an air strike you're looking for, you have to stand still once you've equipped it, and any movement causes it to automatically disable. Considering that there are usually at least half a dozen enemies breathing down your neck anytime you actually need to deploy an air strike, all this standing around and flipping through menus makes it much more practical, though far less satisfying, to stick with smaller-scale explosives like RPGs and bricks of C4. Limiting the number of drops that you can have at the ready to three seems completely arbitrary, especially when you consider the breadth of gear that you need to access this way. It's one of the more significant bottlenecks in the game's ability to deliver a fast-paced, freewheeling experience.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/617985-mercenaries_2_world_in_flames.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-617985" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/617985-mercenaries_2_world_in_flames.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-617985"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/870/617985-mercenaries_2_world_in_flames.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/870/617985-mercenaries_2_world_in_flames.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Awesome explosions like this are the best reason to play Mercs 2.</figcaption></figure> A more streamlined interface would've done wonders for Mercenaries 2, though it's also got plenty of technical issues as well. Graphically, the game could be charitably described as uneven. Texture pop-in and level-of-detail issues are rampant, as are weird clipping issues, though for what it's worth, the frame rate holds up under all but the most hectic of conditions. What really gets me, though, is the sound in Mercs 2. Vehicle sound effects are often grating and monotonous, and middling voice work is made unbearable through repetition. One of the more maddening things about Mercs 2 is the way Fiona, your Australian support agent, will feed you the same completely useless tidbits of information over and over again. At a point I actually found myself mockingly yelling at my TV whenever she'd suggest, often in the middle of a firefight, I come back to headquarters and talk to her if I needed help figuring out what to do next for the 50,000th goddamn time. THANKS FIONA, I'VE KINDA GOT MY HANDS FULL RIGHT NOW.<br/> <br/> The thing is, for all its problems, the basic act of blowing shit up in Mercenaries 2 is incontrovertibly awesome. The way a jeep will flip up into the air in a fiery ball; the wince-inducing white flash of an exploding oil container; the belching dust and debris of a crumbling building; these things are all immensely satisfying, and they make up for a lot of the shortcomings in Mercenaries 2. Unfortunately, while the game's exaggerated physics make for some great, over-the-top explosions, they also make the rest of the game feel weirdly floaty, and it never feels quite as technically sophisticated as other recent physics-heavy games.<br/><br/>That Mercenaries 2: World in Flames isn't better seriously bums me out. Even in its current state you can see so much potential for breakneck, anarchic fun, which makes its laundry list of problems that much more frustrating.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20697/]]></api_detail_url><id>20697</id><name><![CDATA[Mercenaries 2: World in Flames]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mercenaries-2-world-in-flames/3030-20697/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-05 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72878/]]></api_detail_url><id>72878</id><name><![CDATA[Mercenaries 2: World in Flames]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mercenaries-2-world-in-flames-review/1900-53/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-54/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Spore spreads itself a little thin, but the epoch-spanning gameplay and communal creature creation culminate in a one-of-a-kind experience.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/219630-sporeapp_2008_06_30_14_30_57_52.png" data-ref-id="1300-219630" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/219630-sporeapp_2008_06_30_14_30_57_52.png" data-ref-id="1300-219630"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/219630-sporeapp_2008_06_30_14_30_57_52.png"/></a><figcaption>The gameplay's a little simplistic at first...</figcaption></figure><p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">Spore is a game where you sometimes guide and other times merely witness the entire development of a species, from its earliest single-celled origin to its triumphant exploration of the cosmos. So much has been written about and expected of Spore--its promise to connect millions of players through their creative impulses; its importance as the latest offspring of Will Wright's prodigious intellect; its ability to get kids excited about science again--it's easy to forget that, after all, Spore is just a <em>game</em>.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">It's more like five short games, actually, most of which aren't strong enough in pure gameplay terms to stand on their own. Luckily, they don't really have to, since the five phases--cell, creature, tribe, civilization, and space--are unified by a single, believable focus on the evolutionary path--first biological, then cultural and technological--of the species that you create and influence. Spore makes it so easy to shape your creation's appearance, abilities, and behaviors that I couldn't help getting really caught up in governing every aspect, every eye stalk, every planetary colony of my species' journey, from start to finish. The game also does a great job of seamlessly integrating the fruits of other players' creativity into your own game. Even before Spore's official release, I started noticing--and then hunting, domesticating, or battling--other players' species with regularity.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">The game has some unique strengths. Its creation tools are marvelously easy to use, letting you stretch, squish, position, resize, and recolor body parts with a few simple clicks and drags of the mouse. A quick look at the diversity in the <a href="http://www.spore.com/sporepedia#qry=all" rel="nofollow">official Spore site's database</a> will show you just how powerful these tools are. Later on, you spend just as much time designing various kinds of buildings, land vehicles, and spaceships, and the game does a respectable job of making your design choices contribute to the functions and behavior of the animal or machine. The integrated Sporepedia browser makes it fast and easy to peruse the community's creations, too, of which there are already several million only a few days after launch. That's a lot of creatures to play with.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6422/193193-snag_0055.png" data-ref-id="1300-193193" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6422/193193-snag_0055.png" data-ref-id="1300-193193"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6422/193193-snag_0055.png"/></a><figcaption>...but tweaking your species is an effective carrot-on-a-stick device.</figcaption></figure>Here's an example of the connectedness of Spore's community-driven approach to content. In the second phase, when my species had barely emerged from the primordial muck and was just beginning to hunt in packs, I saw a nifty spaceship zooming overhead that belonged to a race in the fifth stage of development. (It swooped down and abducted one of the animals I was hunting, which is an action you do yourself in the space phase.) When I got to the space phase myself at 2am a few days later, I was too sleepy to design my own nifty spaceship, but in seconds I was able to pop into the Sporepedia, find that ship I'd seen days earlier, and commandeer it for my own society's use. Once I started exploring the galaxy, I became enemies with another space-faring species created by one of my friends who was also reviewing the game at the time, whom I'd recently added to my friends list. Those kinds of seamless connections to other players are really neat in an "oh, hey!" kind of way when you encounter them. (It's a tad disappointing that you can't actually play with those friends in real time; you can only interact with their creations, controlled by the computer.) <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">Spore also harnessed my own wide-eyed fascination with physical existence and the scientific enterprises that reveal its nature. The game doesn't stray far from what's believable--no creatures shooting fireballs or anything. Instead, Spore includes headier academic concepts--in a very limited, cartoon-like fashion--such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" rel="nofollow">panspermia</a>, predator/prey dynamics, and the roles that forces like religion and commerce can play in the development of societies.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/219596-sporeapp_2008_06_03_11_27_38_37.png" data-ref-id="1300-219596" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/219596-sporeapp_2008_06_03_11_27_38_37.png" data-ref-id="1300-219596"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/219596-sporeapp_2008_06_03_11_27_38_37.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/219596-sporeapp_2008_06_03_11_27_38_37.png"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Later phases offer more complexity.</figcaption></figure>These days we know so much more about the origins of the universe and life than most people ever stop to think about, that I got downright excited just seeing those subjects addressed in a video game, at all. At times I felt like this game might have been published by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecc" rel="nofollow">MECC</a> instead of Electronic Arts. If I'd been playing Spore in second grade rather than <a data-ref-id="3030-17852" href="/the-oregon-trail/3030-17852" slug="the-oregon-trail">The Oregon Trail</a>, I might have eventually contributed to society as a biologist or astronomer rather than aiding its collapse by writing about video games. I'll get off the soapbox now, but I can appreciate Spore's ability to make you think, even a little bit, about concepts that are bigger than your own daily life. <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">Spore's most positive traits are so uniquely satisfying that it's disappointing the gameplay which underpins them isn't more engrossing. In the early developmental stages, you mostly click repeatedly on your food sources, pausing occasionally to guide the next generation of your species' biological evolution. The tribal and civilization phases get a bit deeper as you go--they introduce elements of cultural interaction that let you guide your budding society's affinity for things like militarism, commerce, and religion. The gameplay starts to resemble real-time strategy more and more with each phase, but even in the fourth stage (civilization), I felt like the intellectual concepts were working on a higher level than the gameplay that was driving them.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">Only the final space phase feels like a fully realized game, where you can while away hours building your galactic empire through trade, exploration, or conquest. Space is Spore's real meat, the final mode which is more involved and time-consuming than all four of the other phases combined. Those phases are necessary, though, since your decisions throughout each step of the game contribute to the abilities and behavior of your society at the peak of its development. A single, inspiring timeline of your species' entire development from single cell to rocket ship illustrates the choices you've made throughout the billions of years the game covers.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/636681-sporeapp2008_09_0614_36_44_00.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-636681" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/636681-sporeapp2008_09_0614_36_44_00.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-636681"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/636681-sporeapp2008_09_0614_36_44_00.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/636681-sporeapp2008_09_0614_36_44_00.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Galactic exploration is where you'll find Spore's real meat.</figcaption></figure>In the space phase, you get to leave the gravitational confines of your own star system and explore the galaxy. Given the breadth of gameplay packed into the rest of Spore, I was surprised how much you can do here in this last stage. You can explore uncharted worlds, terraform them with atmosphere generators and land-shaping tools, and then set up mining colonies. You can meet and parley with other alien empires, taking on missions for them or just kicking them a cash gift to get in their good graces. You can elect to be a galactic jerk and declare war on the species you meet, taking their colony worlds by force to bolster your own empire. The game gives you plenty of planets to visit and numerical tallies to increment in this phase, and it's all couched in a believably quasi-scientific motif that displays an attention to plausible detail by indicating which planetary orbits are in or out of the fabled "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone" rel="nofollow">Goldilocks zone</a>," for instance, or giving its stars realistic coloration, as few space-based games do. (This is exciting stuff for space nerds. Leave me alone.) <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">Your prosperity on the galactic scene stands on the edge of a knife in the space phase, though, and you have to be extra careful not to piss off too many other species. I made some poor diplomatic decisions early on and paid for it dearly as two enemy empires took turns overtaking all my colonies and then pounding the hell out of my home world, as I scrambled for hours to build up enough cash to buy them off. Your enjoyment of this mode will definitely benefit from experience and repeated playthroughs, and though you can start a game in any of the five phases with a new creature whenever you want, I wish I could have also restarted the space phase with my evolved species and all the choices I'd made for it up to that time.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">I feel like Spore hasn't really gotten a fair shake.

That's largely because there hasn't been another meaningful organization to license for years. Recently, Orlando-based TNA Wrestling has risen to becoming a meaningful, though certainly smaller alternative to the WWE. So it's no surprise that the rise of a new wrestling organization has led to the rise of a new wrestling game based on the promotion. And much like TNA's weekly television show, Midway's interactive take on things is a combination of terrific highs and crushing lows. When you push all of those goods and bads together, you get a game that has a great deal of potential, but has a lot of quirks and annoying issues that really hold it back.</div><br/><div>The most standout thing about TNA iMPACT! is its gameplay. It's a much faster game than you're probably used to if you've been following the genre for the last few years. Also, the controls feel nicely streamlined. It's easy to pick up the contoller, mess around for a few minutes, and get a good feel for when and where to use each of your attacks. The game uses a modifier button to execute "strong" versions of many attacks, and this button is what changes a simple run against the ropes into a dive that takes you through the ropes, out onto the floor, and (ideally) crashing down on top of your opponent.</div><br/><div>The game is also very counter-focused with an emphasis on proper timing to avoid and reverse attacks. The window for countering moves is really tight, though, which makes it difficult to get used to. It also makes countering in online matches tough when the connection to the other player isn't great.</div><br/><div>There's a downside to the game's easy control, though. The game doesn't offer as many moves as you'd expect, and it's easy to find yourself doing the same "toward+strong grapple" move again and again and again. It seemed like I spent most of my time in the story mode just suplexing people repeatedly, then whipping them into a turnbuckle so I could grab them and smash their head into the corner four times.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5469/649523-tna0000000086.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-649523" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5469/649523-tna0000000086.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-649523"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5469/649523-tna0000000086.jpg"/></a><figcaption>TNA's action takes place in a six-sided ring.</figcaption></figure>The game's match types cover most of the basic things you'd expect from a four-player game, but you won't find any sort of "no disqualification" or "hardcore" match in here. That's because all the matches are no DQ. There's no ref in the ring, you can't get counted out, and there are always plenty of chairs around the ring that are free to use as weapons. The only meaningful gimmick match is the Ultimate X, which is a match that positions a big friggin' X above the center of the ring, hanging from cables that attach to four of the turnbuckles. To win, someone must climb up a turnbuckle, climb out onto the cables, shimmy over to the X, and play a timing-based minigame to unhook it from the cables. It's a good addition.</div><br/><div>The main single-player component to TNA is a story mode that opens with you playing the role of a fictional wrestler named Suicide. Suicide wins the TNA championship instead of taking a dive, so he's laid out by the tag team LAX and dumped in Tijuana with amnesia and a messed-up face. That brings you into the create-a-wrestler menus. You pick a new name for yourself and through your inherent, subliminal thirst for wrestling, find yourself working your way back to TNA. With your new look, the guys who hated you before don't recognize you.</div><br/><div>The thing about the story mode is that it starts with a solid premise--it's certainly more interesting than anything that TNA has put on its television programming for the past few months. But the game almost immediately sticks you in a bunch of awful, boring tag team matches with Eric Young as your partner. Most of the time, there's no rhyme or reason to your matches, either. You just proceed through matches with no real end in sight until the game decides to spring a cutscene on you. Also, a large chunk of your time in story mode is spent wrestling created wrestlers, not actual TNA talent. With more interaction with the guys you actually watch TNA to see and some more story sequences to keep things focused, this could have been a much better mode.</div><br/><div>For some players, a wrestling game lives and dies by its create-a-wrestler options. Those players will not enjoy this game. That's not to say that the character creation options are bad, it's more that they're pretty squarely focused on letting you make average-looking wrestling dudes, as opposed to slyly including parts that let you re-create wrestlers from the past. Outside of a decidedly Stone Cold Steve Austin-like vest and a variety of lucha masks, you're probably going to end up with a guy that looks like a low-rent, mid-card wrestler... which is pretty much perfect for the story mode.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5469/649544-tna0000000009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-649544" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5469/649544-tna0000000009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-649544"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5469/649544-tna0000000009.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5469/649544-tna0000000009.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Samoa Joe would like to be the first to welcome you to this menu screen.</figcaption></figure>Visually, the game has nice character models and textures, but the canned, motion-captured movement makes it feel like you're just setting off strings of animation instead of actually moving around and executing techniques. Also, there are plenty of spots where the models clip through each other, so don't be surprised to see one guy's foot sticking out of the other guy's back.</div><br/><div>The audio in the game is awesome in some spots. Things like slamming a wrestler into a turnbuckle sound like someone being murdered. Body slams and other moves that send wrestlers crashing to the mat also sound thunderously nice. It's backed up by some of the weakest commentary I've heard in awhile. Don West and Mike Tenay rarely say anything related to the action, and when they do, it's almost always a few seconds too late. On top of that, they repeat themselves a lot, and the game rarely uses a wrestler's name, so it's a lot of "he" this and "he" that.</div><br/><div>The overall feeling that TNA iMPACT! leaves me with is that it's a solid first step. With some iteration, more content, and more vocal contributions from more members of the TNA roster, a sequel could be just as viable of an alternative to the SmackDown! series as TNA's brand of wrestling is to WWE's.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20469/]]></api_detail_url><id>20469</id><name><![CDATA[TNA iMPACT!]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/tna-impact/3030-20469/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-12 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72379/]]></api_detail_url><id>72379</id><name><![CDATA[TNA iMPACT!]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tna-impact-review/1900-55/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-56/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Rock Band 2 offers a great package of new music and a bunch of great enhancements to the core game that make it a terrific purchase whether you're already well-versed in the genre or looking to get started.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176184-rb7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176184" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.55579058699101" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176184-rb7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176184"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/176184-rb7.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Yeah, it still looks like Rock Band.</figcaption></figure>Rock Band 2 isn't a vast overhaul of the Rock Band formula. Instead, it's a set of intelligent updates to the progression and periphery of the game designed to make sure you get to see the cool stuff, regardless of how you're playing. If you spent a serious chunk of time trying to play Rock Band with other players, you probably remember how much of a pain it could be to get the right band members together into the right band, or how much of a hassle it was to play the Band World Tour mode when you were missing a key member. All of that madness is gone, replaced by smart solutions that are almost enough to make the first game obsolete.</div><br/><div>The streamlining done to the Band World Tour mode makes it the main way to play, regardless of the number of players available. You can play it alone, or with up to three other players. Also, those additional slots can be filled with any mixture of local and remote players. So if you and two friends want to play and no one wants to sing, you should be able to hit "find players" and get matched up with a willing vocalist online.</div><br/><div>Beyond making it easier to get a group together, the World Tour hasn't changed too much. It's still about going from city to city, earning upgrades like a bus or a plane, playing mystery setlists, and building your band up by earning fans, money, and stars for performing. In addition to unlocking new cities to play, you also unlock the ability to hire staff members, which can give you a bonus to the number of fans you get, or give you more special opportunities, like charity shows or music video shoots. If you mainly played this mode in the original Rock Band, you won't see a ton of changes here. You will see more of the little things that make the entire game seem like it was crafted by a passionate group of people that really understand the subject matter. When you see your band's new merchandise girl described as an "unofficial band den mother... a den mother who is always trying to make out with you," it's plainly obvious that these people have been there. That really goes a long way.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7596/193031-rb2_guitar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-193031" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.66732673267327" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7596/193031-rb2_guitar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-193031"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7596/193031-rb2_guitar.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The new guitar has sensors on it that make calibrating your setup a snap.</figcaption></figure>You use your created band in more ways this time around, including a set of local challenges that give you a tiered set of things to complete. This concept goes online with the new Battle of the Bands mode, which has the potential to be a very big hook that keeps you coming back. With Battle of the Bands, the designers back at Harmonix are able to configure and launch timed challenges with a variety of criteria. You're able to participate in the challenge again and again, with your best performance going on the leaderboard for that challenge. The challenges seem to be really configurable, ranging from individual songs to sets that include songs from Rock Band 2, the original game, or downloadable content. Some challenges are locked to solo performances on specific instruments, while others let you take any number of players in. Some of them force specific difficulties, or keep score in alternate ways, such as the longest streak on guitar, or the number of stars earned over the course of multiple songs.</div><br/><div>Even if you don't really care about the gameplay changes, Rock Band 2 is still a good value if taken merely as a set of new songs. The game comes with over 80 songs on the disc, and they're all from the original artists. There's a lot of variety covering multiple decades and genres, and you can check out our <a data-ref-id="3030-20714" href="/rock-band-2/3030-20714" slug="rock-band-2">info page</a> on the game for a full song list. Some of my favorites include <span><em>Round and Round</em></span> by Ratt, <em>Spoonman</em> by Soundgarden, and <em>Cool for Cats</em> by Squeeze. The key to the material is that most of it's actually fun to play. It's a true testament to how much fun playing the game actually is that it can make you forget that Paramore is, you know, awful. Heck, even the kind-of-bad new Guns N' Roses song that makes its legal debut in the game is OK in the context of the game.</div><br/><div>The game also comes with a code that will be used to download an additional 20 songs. The details on what those songs are and when they'll be available haven't been announced yet. The code does seem to be a one-time use sort of deal, though, so consider that if you're thinking about buying a used copy.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12508/259274-rb21.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-259274" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56285714285714" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12508/259274-rb21.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-259274"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12508/259274-rb21.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12508/259274-rb21.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>You'll occasionally get to shoot a music video, which results in some different on-screen effects.</figcaption></figure>Rock Band 2 is probably the smartest music game to date when it comes to handling songs from previous games. The game contains the same music store interface that was patched into the original game, and anything you might have purchased for the first game is automatically made available in Rock Band 2. Additionally, you can take your original Rock Band disc and purchase an export license for five dollars. This lets you copy all but a few of the songs from the first game onto your hard drive, and Rock Band 2 sees those just like it sees downloadable tracks. That means that you could have hundreds of songs available to you all in one game. It's a daunting list when you see it all scrolling in front of you on the song select screen, but the game lets you sort the songs in a number of different ways to make it easier to find what you want. The game mixes the old stuff into the game pretty well, occasionally including it in mystery setlists and letting you choose it at will when creating a set of songs or just playing the quickplay mode.</div><br/><div>Outside of the new songs and gameplay changes, the game also has a hidden, sinister motive: it's trying to create a world of drummers. Though just playing the game and working your way through the different difficulties would make you more able to work both arms and one foot with more style and expertise, Rock Band 2 has a drum trainer mode that lets you try your hand at playing different drum parts and fills at different tempos. The fills seem more focused on making you not sound awful whenever a freestyle fill section shows up in the real game by giving you a variety of ideas on fills. The main mode is more focused on a handful of different beats. If you can get 100 percent on a beat, it'll light up and be marked as completed. There are achievements based on completing tracks at either the middle or higher tempos. Getting more practice on the drums will certainly make you a better Rock Band drummer. And it's almost guaranteed that once you learn that level of coordination, you'll be able to approach a real drum kit with a slightly higher rate of success. But there's nothing here to explain to you what you're doing wrong, and nothing there to really teach you how to keep an internal tempo. So the drum trainer may assist in the creation of a nation of drummers... but we'll all be playing to click tracks.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/415241-0003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-415241" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/415241-0003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-415241"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4759/415241-0003.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4759/415241-0003.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>This pedal feels quite a bit sturdier than the old one.</figcaption></figure>The hardware has also undergone another round of revisions for Rock Band 2. The drums are now wireless, requiring three AA batteries for power. The drums are substantially quieter than the kit that was initially issued alongside the original game, and the pads are velocity sensitive. That means the drums know if you're hitting them softly or wailing away, but this doesn't really have any impact on the gameplay. The kick pedal, prone to breaking on the original kit, appears to be made of much sterner stuff this time around. The guitar, also wireless, is a redesigned version of the original. The strum bar feels a lot better and, overall, the whole thing feels much sturdier and resistant to damage than the previous guitars did.</div><br/><div>Also new on the guitars is a sound and light sensor that you can use to calibrate the audio/video lag on your setup. Before, you sort of had to eyeball this stuff, with varying results. Now, you hold the guitar up to a speaker for an audio check, then up to the TV for a series of flashes that check the visual latency. This new method appears to be totally successful--I tried it on a few different HDTVs with perfect results every time. While you could certainly get a nearly identical experience with your old hardware, if you're thinking of switching to the new stuff, it's totally worth it.</div><br/><div>Considering how serious Harmonix and MTV have been when it comes to post-release support via weekly song downloads, the initial announcement of Rock Band 2 caught me off guard. Aside from being a method for offline players to acquire music, it didn't seem necessary at all. But with its large library of licensed master recordings and vastly improved approach to multiplayer play, Rock Band 2 is a terrific value at both ends. It's both a must-own for fans of the genre and a great place for new players to get started.</div><br/><div><em>Editorial Disclosure: We are pretty good friends with a guy who has his name in the credits of this game.

That's part of why the story in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed left me pretty impressed. The tale of Darth Vader's secret apprentice slots itself into a space just prior to the events of <em>Star Wars</em>. As a result, you get to see some pretty pivotal stuff along the way. Of course, all this comes with a catch. The action is insanely uneven, flipping back and forth between an easy and fun physics toy to overwhelming combat sequences that feel like they belong in a different game.</div><br/><div>Things start out slowly enough, with an <a data-ref-id="3015-57" href="/abilitease/3015-57" slug="abilitease">abilitease</a>-style segment that has you playing as Darth Vader with all of the available Force powers. After that quick and easy mission, things accelerate a bit and you take control of Vader's new apprentice, a young adult named Starkiller. Since he's still building his strength, you'll only have a few abilities at the outset, but one more thing unlocks per level. The first power you get, Force lift, is also the most fun. With it you can lift up objects or enemies, move them around in the air, flip them around all crazy-like, and fling them into other things. Stormtroopers will hopelessly attempt to grab onto rails, boxes, or even each other for safety, resulting in moments where you have two of them, holding hands, flipping around in mid-air. I could have played the entire game this way, if it had let me.</div><br/><div>Unfortunately, you can only really get away with that sort of slow play for the first two missions. After that, the pace picks up in a big way, and you'll be too busy being surrounded and maimed by enemies to slowly use your telekinesis powers to do the damage. The biggest problem with The Force Unleashed is its erratic pacing. Things go from easy to frustratingly difficult and back again at the blink of an eye. At various points in the game you find yourself completely surrounded by enemies that block or avoid most of your Force powers, which instead makes you rely on your lightsaber. The melee combat is more sophisticated than you'd expect out of a game like this, but you only really need to rely on a handful of basic attacks to succeed. In addition to a basic four-hit combo that you get by just mashing the attack button, you can also unlock different branching attacks that add a little Force power to your strikes. So you can bust out a lighting combo or two, use Force push to bounce an enemy into the air for juggle combos, and so on. Most of the button presses for Force attacks and melee combos are well-designed, but it's a little surprising to see how technical some of the moves get, especially when you only really need a few basic attacks to get through the game.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/627706-skprox.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-627706" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/627706-skprox.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-627706"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/627706-skprox.jpg"/></a><figcaption>PROXY is your friendly robot sidekick.</figcaption></figure>All of the combat suffers a bit due to poor targeting. When you have a grip of enemies running in your direction, you usually want to use Force lightning to stun or eliminate the smaller guys so you can focus on the larger targets. But pointing at the right enemy can prove to be difficult, especially when your targets are up close. This led to a lot of frustrating deaths that felt like they were totally out of my control. Also, the lightsaber feels grossly underpowered when you compare it to how the weapon has been portrayed in films. This thing should be running through Stormtroopers with one swing, leaving nothing but severed and cauterized limbs in its wake. This being a T-rated game, it shouldn't come as a surprise to you that you won't see any limbs flying around here. But it also takes multiple strikes to take things down, and this also seems incongruous with what the weapon is "really" capable of.</div><br/><div>While I'm getting all down on things that don't quite match up with how they've been portrayed elsewhere, boy, there sure are a lot of different types of Stormtroopers in this game. You would think that the divisions of flamethrower-wieiding troopers with big energy shields that block all Force-related attacks would have survived long enough to be portrayed in the films. In fact, the sheer number of Force-sensitive and Force-resistant enemies in the game feels pretty out-of-whack when you stop and think about it. Of course, the game is better when you don't think about it. Your ability to suspend disbelief against something that already requires you to suspend disbelief may be stretched to its breaking point by this game, or you may be able to happily write it all off as exactly the sort of things that a developer has to do to give a game variety.</div><br/><div>The combat issues culminate in the game's boss fights. As the bulk of your missions are about hunting down Jedi, the game's battles pit you against a fighter with many of the same moves that you have. The boss fights feel out of place with the rest of the action. Though they're significantly more difficult than most of the other battles, that's not because you're having an interesting, balanced fight. Instead, it's not very easy to discern what weaknesses your enemy may have, when he or she may be susceptible to certain attacks, and so on. I felt like I was somehow cheating my way through the battles by finding little corners of the screen that rendered me safe from incoming Force pushed objects and stuff like that. Overall, none of them were much fun at all and felt like the game was trying to do something that it wasn't designed to handle. Plus, almost every major battle against a boss or large enemy ends in a God of War-like <a data-ref-id="3015-6" href="/quick-time-event/3015-6" slug="quick-time-event">quick time event</a>. Not to make sweeping judgments of well-worn game mechanics or anything, but that barely interactive stuff is starting to feel <em>really</em> dated.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/627702-fujuuno.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-627702" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/627702-fujuuno.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-627702"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/627702-fujuuno.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/627702-fujuuno.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>This pretty British lady is your pilot.</figcaption></figure>The game's story is helped along by some good voice performances from the actors voicing Vader, Starkiller, your pilot, your friendly robot sidekick, and so on. I didn't much care for the music in the game, as the standard John Williams-like music that you expect from a Star Wars game is present and accounted for. It'd be nice to see something a little more modern-sounding in a Star Wars game, but I guess that's one of those "it's not Star Wars without..." things that you just can't mess with without inciting a riot in the process.</div><br/><div>The Force Unleashed looks nice from start to finish, both in its cutscenes and during the game itself. The game delivers a lot of different-looking locations, from wild-looking plant worlds to enemy-filled junkyards to the interiors of large, unfinished installations. Each one looks good in its own way, with enemies that match. Along with the standard canned animations for your attacks, the game also has loads of intelligent ragdoll behavior that makes flinging things around and blowing open doors with the Force look cool.</div><br/><div>Overall, the story is the main thing that I'll remember about The Force Unleashed--I found it to be more satisfying than the last three movies combined. Though you go in sort of knowing how it has to end, since it has to lead into <em>Star Wars</em>, there are plenty of significant events occurring throughout. It's enjoyable to watch it all unfold. That said, it's unfortunate that the game isn't a bit more even, because the constant flips from too easy to too hard really drag things down and prevent The Force Unleashed from being great. But even with its lengthy list of caveats, The Force Unleashed is still one of the best Star Wars games to be released in quite some time.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20626/]]></api_detail_url><id>20626</id><name><![CDATA[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/star-wars-the-force-unleashed/3030-20626/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-15 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72813/]]></api_detail_url><id>72813</id><name><![CDATA[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/star-wars-the-force-unleashed-review/1900-57/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-58/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Strong Bad goes all Che Guevara in Episode 2, with amusing results.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/659112-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-659112" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/659112-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-659112"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4938/659112-1.png"/></a><figcaption>The Art of War, Strong-Bad-style.</figcaption></figure>It's one month later, and Telltale returns with the second installment in its webcomic-inspired episodic adventure game, Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People: Strong Badia the Free. While it shows no signs of building any overarching story for the “season”, and the basic formula remains unchanged, it's a much fuller and funnier experience than the first episode.<br/><br/>The game opens with the traditional, ceremonial email reading, this time asking <a data-ref-id="3005-1994" href="/strong-bad/3005-1994" slug="strong-bad">Strong Bad</a> about the dumbest law the <a data-ref-id="3005-6461" href="/the-king-of-town/3005-6461" slug="the-king-of-town">King of Town</a> has ever passed. One non sequitur leads to another, and after an incident involving snack cakes, house arrest, and  “taxation without representin',” Strong Bad frees himself from the oppressive, gravy-stained tyranny of the King of Town. With Strong Badia now a sovereign nation, the other residents of Town follow suit, each establishing their own, tailor-made fiefdom. <br/><br/>A good deal of humor is mined from punny, made-up country names and the residents' bizarre takes on international relations--<a data-ref-id="3005-6460" href="/bubs/3005-6460" slug="bubs">Bubs</a>' Concession Stand hosts a poorly stocked black market for weapons, cultural artifacts, and organs, and <a data-ref-id="3005-6456" href="/strong-mad/3005-6456" slug="strong-mad">Strong Mad</a>'s idea of diplomacy is to just yell “DIPLOMACY!” There are also some good wartime newsreel gags, and even a reference to Ken Burns' <em>Civil War</em>. Fans should appreciate the increased presence of <a data-ref-id="3005-6307" href="/homsar/3005-6307" slug="homsar">Homsar</a>, who delivers a number of amusingly nonsensical gems. Amusing is actually a pretty good description of Strong Badia the Free in general--there were a few laugh-out-loud moments, but I was highly amused throughout. <br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/660820-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-660820" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/660820-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-660820"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4938/660820-1.png"/></a><figcaption>THE POOPSMITH!</figcaption></figure>One of my issues with the first episode was a general sense of aimlessness, something Strong Badia the Free curbs by providing a clearer, single objective for the majority of the game. This isn't to say that there aren't some befuddling puzzles scattered throughout, but they're not too arbitrary, and the game generally avoids frustration. Strong Badia the Free reuses a few lines from the first episode, but the game introduces as many new locations as it revisits, and it doesn't yet feel overly recycled. It also seems a little longer than the first episode, by maybe an hour or so.<br/><br/>The lack of a continuing plot might hurt Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People's ability to keep players coming back in the long run, but considering the self-contained nature of <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html" rel="nofollow">Strong Bad Email</a>, it's kind of fitting. So far, though, the episodes have been funny enough to keep me coming back anyway.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23066/]]></api_detail_url><id>23066</id><name><![CDATA[Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People Episode 2: Strong Badia The Free]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episod/3030-23066/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-18 10:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-76973/]]></api_detail_url><id>76973</id><name><![CDATA[Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People Episode 2: Strong Badia The Free]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episod/1900-58/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii Shop, PC]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-59/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Even though the 360's lackluster D-pad does its best to hold it back, Samurai Shodown II still shines on Xbox Live Arcade.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/639647-2839392841_c81c76e840_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-639647" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/639647-2839392841_c81c76e840_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-639647"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/639647-2839392841_c81c76e840_o.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The game locks the screen size down the original 4:3 aspect ratio.</figcaption></figure>Samurai Shodown II is one of the all-time greats when it comes to 2D fighting games. SNK's weapon-focused fighter offers enough moves to keep your opponent guessing, and the rage gauge and impact of the game's heavy attacks means that matches can turn on a dime. While it's received plenty of ports off of the Neo Geo hardware over the years, the Xbox Live Arcade release is especially notable for including online play. Thankfully, the online play is perfectly capable over decent connections and the quality of the emulation is just fine, as well.<br/></div><br/><div>There's a catch, of course. There's always one. If you've been playing 2D fighters on the Xbox 360 for any length of time you probably know where I'm going with this: the D-pad. The Xbox 360 D-pad is less-than-ideal for this sort of game, and the analog stick is probably worse. Normally, I try not to complain about the 360's D-pad because I don't normally have a ton of issues with it, but as many of SNK's games are filled with crazy controller motions to pull off supers and such, it's more of an issue here than it is in, say, Ulitmate Mortal Kombat 3.</div><br/><div>The hardware issue can't keep a good game down, though. Samurai Shodown II still plays extremely well, especially with others. The accuracy of the emulation seems right on, as well. The game offers the same type of graphical smoothing that Metal Slug 3 and Fatal Fury Special had, and it looks pretty bad. You're better off disabling it so you can see every filthy, blocky pixel the way it was originally meant to be seen, red arterial spray and all. Who knew that HDTVs would be so good for displaying old sprite-based arcade games and finally banishing the blurry mess that we got used to back on our standard-definition sets?</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/639652-2840228776_b01424088d_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-639652" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/639652-2840228776_b01424088d_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-639652"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/639652-2840228776_b01424088d_o.jpg"/></a><figcaption>While I respect most of the game's roster, I only really play as Haohmaru.</figcaption></figure>The menus are rather bare, which is fine if you already know what you're getting yourself into. But you won't find a move list or anything else of use in the game's menus, so if you're getting into it for the first time, you might need to do a bit of out-of-game research.</div><br/><div>The online support is the standard set of Xbox 360 options, with the one real difference being that the player matching screen actually shows a real ping time in milliseconds, not some friendly little green light or four bars or some other less-specific indication. As you might expect, lower-ping games play just fine, but once you get over the 200ms mark, things start to get a little funny. Furthermore, there don't seem to be a ton of people playing at any given time. Sometimes I was unable to find any opponents, other times I'd join games only to be kicked out, probably because the host is attempting to cheat his way through the game's achievements, which include points for 100 online wins and ten straight online victories. Many of the online players I've faced have been quite good, so expect an uphill battle if you're going to attempt to honestly earn your ranked victories.</div><br/><div>Samurai Shodown is a great series, and as far as I'm concerned, SS2 is the best installment of the bunch. Between that and the game's online support, I'm well satisfied with this release. If you have fond memories of '90s arcades, I'd guess that you'll be satisfied, as well.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-16407/]]></api_detail_url><id>16407</id><name><![CDATA[Samurai Shodown II]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/samurai-shodown-ii/3030-16407/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-23 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-77323/]]></api_detail_url><id>77323</id><name><![CDATA[Samurai Shodown II]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/samurai-shodown-ii-review/1900-59/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-60/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Namco Bandai strikes out with this halfhearted baseball game.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3498/609078-mariosupersluggers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-609078" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.525" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3498/609078-mariosupersluggers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-609078"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3498/609078-mariosupersluggers2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Free agents are ruining the sport!</figcaption></figure>Paul Verhoeven's <em>Starship Troopers</em> is one of my favorite movies of all time. At a passing glance it just seems like a bloated, brain-dead summer blockbuster, where pricey special effects are meant to distract from the by-the-numbers plot and the sub-soap-opera acting. Those paying attention, however, will find a scathing indictment of fascism and conformity, a brilliant mass-media satire, and perhaps one of the most politically subversive films to come out of Hollywood in the past 20 years. That said, I have absolutely no interest in its direct-to-video sequels. It's still space marines fighting giant space bugs, but without the creative forces that brought life to the original, they're nothing more than the stupid action movies they appear to be.<br/><br/>Similarly, I've got a deep and abiding appreciation for the Mario franchise, but that doesn't mean that every Mario game gets an automatic pass. Namco Bandai's Mario Super Sluggers is, for all intents and purposes, a direct-to-video Mario game. It's got all the characters you expect from a Mario game, but without Nintendo actually handling the development duties, the whole thing has a real off-brand feel. Mario Super Sluggers is also a baseball game of sorts, albeit one that is simultaneously too casual about the sport itself and not imaginative enough about how it exploits the Mario motif.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1899/389726-picture_2.png" data-ref-id="1300-389726" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="464" style="width: 464px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1899/389726-picture_2.png" data-ref-id="1300-389726"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1899/389726-picture_2.png"/></a><figcaption>The game was called on account of Bloopers.</figcaption></figure>As has become the default MO for many Wii games, Mario Super Sluggers puts a high value on accessibility, providing you with three distinct control schemes, two of which have you making use of the motion controls--one with the nunchuk, one without--and one that has you holding the Wii Remote sideways. I like to think that I've become fairly aware of the technical limitations of the Wii Remote over the past few years, and can adjust my play style accordingly, but I found the motion controls in Super Sluggers to be particularly inconsistent. The remote-and-nunchuk combo might provide a greater degree of control, but I found the sideways control scheme to be the most reliable and easy to use.<br/><br/>The game abides by the basic rules of the sport, focusing most of its energy on batting and pitching, though even then there's not a lot of nuance. When you're at bat, it's simply a matter of timing your swing--there's no consideration for the shape or speed of your swing when using the motion controls, and every character comes with a predetermined batting power. There's a bit more to the pitching, which accommodates fastball, change-up, and curveball throws, though it also seems to require less skill. You'll have varying levels of control over your fielders and your base runners depending on your control scheme, but I found them to be either too automatic or not responsive enough.<br/><br/>You can build your own teams out of the usual rabbit-hole menagerie of characters you expect to see in a Mario game, and in addition to each character having discrete performance stats, you'll find that certain characters work better together. The allegiances tend to break down the way you'd expect, but it still manages to make the team-building an interesting exercise. <br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1899/389740-picture_33.png" data-ref-id="1300-389740" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5599128540305" data-width="459" style="width: 459px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1899/389740-picture_33.png" data-ref-id="1300-389740"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1899/389740-picture_33.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1899/389740-picture_33.png"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Toy Field is the best thing about Mario Super Sluggers.</figcaption></figure>Mario Super Sluggers spikes the action with a few Mario touches, such as the ability to build up star power when either batting or pitching. Every character reacts slightly differently, but activating it it generally results in a powerful swing or a speedy, unpredictable pitch, depending on which side of the plate you're on. Star power tends to build up quick, effectively providing a free pass every other at-bat. You'll also find stadiums with different surfaces, and the ability to throw “error items” out onto the field while you're running the bases, but these touches tend to muddle the gameplay rather than enhance it.<br/><br/>Beyond the standard exhibition game and the surprisingly brief story-based challenge mode, Mario Super Sluggers offers some minigames to test and hone the skills you'll need to employ in a standard game. They can be OK on the lower difficulty levels, but at a point the minigames just seem like a showcase for the gameplay's shortcomings. Then there's the Toy Field mode, which crosses baseball with pinball. This is easily my favorite part of the game, simply because it abstracts the sport to such a degree that the simplicity of the gameplay doesn't seem like a liability. In this mode, four players take turns at bat, while the other three players are out in the field, which is divided into a grid of panels, each with its own point value. The fielders then trigger a slot machine that determines the pitch, as well as whether any error items get tossed out. Points are awarded to the batter for contact with different field panels, and fielders can get points for catching the ball, or simply stealing the ball from another fielder. After a set number of turns, scores are tallied and a winner declared. I only wish there was more action like this in Mario Super Sluggers.<br/><br/>As a Mario game, Mario Super Sluggers feels kind of cheap; as a baseball game, it fails to capture the finer points that make the sport interesting in the first place. Its accessibility is probably Mario Super Sluggers' most well-realized characteristic, but what you're getting access to simply isn't much fun.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20948/]]></api_detail_url><id>20948</id><name><![CDATA[Mario Super Sluggers]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mario-super-sluggers/3030-20948/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-26 11:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73456/]]></api_detail_url><id>73456</id><name><![CDATA[Mario Super Sluggers]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mario-super-sluggers-review/1900-60/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-61/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Pure looks great and plays well, providing enough tricks to keep things moving and enough tracks to keep things varied.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/609973-sandy_mountairace2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-609973" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/609973-sandy_mountairace2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-609973"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/609973-sandy_mountairace2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Tricks = boost = more tricks = more boost.</figcaption></figure>Pure isn't a very evocative name for an ATV racing game. When it comes to the ATV games, we usually get a lot of manly sounding terms like "off-road" or "fury" or "frenzy." Pure sounds pristine and white like snow. It sounds like the name of a snowboarding game. Maybe, in some weird subliminal way, that was the plan all along, because Disney's ATV racing game has more in common with the SSX series than with the multitudes of other ATV games that have been released over the years.<br/></div><br/><div>There's a refined simplicity to Pure's mechanics that boils down to the basic "more tricks equals more boost" style of play. As you go off of big jumps, you do tricks. Tricks fill your "thrill bar," which is another fancy way of saying "boost meter." You can hit your boost at any time, but filling it up gives you access to more tricks, which gives you more potential for earning boost. Filling up the bar gives you a special trick that can be used at any time, regardless of how full your meter is, but you'll need a big jump to have enough time to land the trick properly. Landing a special trick refills your boost meter, creating a situation where you can boost almost constantly as long as you occasionally land a special trick.</div><br/><div>The trick system isn't too sophisticated, but it's not as shallow as it initially seems, either. Most tricks are done with by pushing one of the three trick buttons and a direction on the analog stick. But you can also hit another button to tweak that trick into another one, effectively doubling the amount of tricks you can pull. The game is very big on trick variety, and won't reward you with much boost if you do a trick you've already done. This actually becomes kind of a hassle, as it can be hard to remember which tricks you have and haven't done as the event wears on. The trick and boost features are joined by a standard suspension pre-loading mechanic, which helps you get more air off of jumps. The whole thing is easy to pick-up and understand.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4745/256432-pure_18.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-256432" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56106194690265" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4745/256432-pure_18.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-256432"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4745/256432-pure_18.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Yes, you can do a Seat Grab Superman.</figcaption></figure>That gameplay is dropped into a few not-so-different race types and set into a single-player progression that feeds the races to you in a set of different classes and events. As you win events, you'll unlock more events, along with additional ATV parts. The game has a lot of different parts that you'll cram together to build your bike. If you don't feel like taking the time to customize every little bit, you can hold down a build button to quickly slap something together. The parts you start the game with can only construct D-class rides--pretty slow, not that exciting. Getting the A-class stuff makes the game fun, though getting there takes some time.</div><br/><div>Pure also has online multiplayer, which lets up to 16 players race at the same time. This, you would think, would be where the real fun lies, but that's only the case if you pour a heaping helping of time into the single-player, as you'll still need to unlock all of those hot bike parts before you can use them online. And without those parts, it's tough to remain competitive.</div><br/><div>The last piece to Pure is an important one--it's the graphics. Pure looks great and runs fast. You'll get a good sense of speed on the ground and you'll get to see enough of the surrounding environment to make those huge jumps look positively majestic. The rider animations are perhaps a bit stiff, and the crashes are cut so short that they start to look a little weird, but overall, it looks terrific.</div><br/><div>It might not sport licensed riders, but with plenty of licensed parts and solid gameplay, it's easy to imagine that most fans of ATV action will enjoy Pure. But there's also that SSX connection, as the game's fast speed and reliance on tricks will probably give it plenty of appeal to fans of EA's criminally dormant snowboarding line, too.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20957/]]></api_detail_url><id>20957</id><name><![CDATA[Pure]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pure/3030-20957/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-26 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-76469/]]></api_detail_url><id>76469</id><name><![CDATA[Pure]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/pure-review/1900-61/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-62/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[While it feels more like fond memories than the near future, Wipeout HD still delivers plenty of high-speed, techno-laced thrills.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5450/700349-wohd_20080927_075947.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-700349" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5450/700349-wohd_20080927_075947.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-700349"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5450/700349-wohd_20080927_075947.jpg.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The future!</figcaption></figure>When I saw <a data-ref-id="3030-3654" href="/wipeout-xl/3030-3654" slug="wipeout-xl"> Wipeout XL</a> for the first time, I saw the future--and not some far-flung,  dilithium-crystal-powered future, but something sooner, and something extrapolated from the world as I knew it. It was all pan-Eurasian corporate sponsors, techno music, and energy drinks, and it was all so frightfully new. My experiences with most other futuristic racing games (save for the criminally underrated <a data-ref-id="3030-4978" href="/xg3-extreme-g-racing/3030-4978" slug="xg3-extreme-g-racing"> Extreme-G III</a>) since then have taught me that my connection with Wipeout XL was a right-place, right-time situation that could not be recreated. Still, 12 years later I still harbor a general fondness for Wipeout, and while the PlayStation Network release of Wipeout HD isn't a mind-expanding experience, it's a slick package that reminds me exactly why I loved Wipeout in the first place.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that Wipeout HD is less a full new entry in the series than it is a high-definition compilation of bits and pieces from <a data-ref-id="3030-14796" href="/wipeout-pure/3030-14796" slug="wipeout-pure"> Wipeout Pure</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-20596" href="/wipeout-pulse/3030-20596" slug="wipeout-pulse"> Wipeout Pulse</a> for the PSP, which were themselves brimming with designs that dated back to the original Wipeout. While not nearly as exciting as an all-new Wipeout game, the series aesthetic translates to a crisp HD display so well that it's kind of difficult to imagine how the series made do before 1080p. Some of the track designs feel a little safe, and the sleek graphical style loses a bit of its luster when you're not burying the needle, but the ships look sharp and the frame rate is rock-solid. The music of Wipeout XL was as significant as anything else about that game, if not more so. Wipeout HD may not feature huge acts like  The Prodigy,  Daft Punk, or The Chemical Brothers, but there are still plenty of chilly synths, warbley bass tones, and thumping backbeats to race to.<br/><br/>With so much of its content recycled from past Wipeout games, it's unsurprising that the game doesn't really take many chances with the gameplay. The single-player campaign will throw standard race, time trial, speed lap, tournament, and zone races at you as you work your way up to faster and scarier speed classes. It seems like virtually every memorable team sponsor and ship design from the series has been crammed in here, and in addition to each having unique performance stats, you'll also earn loyalty points whenever you race for that team. Accumulate enough loyalty points for a particular team, and you'll unlock fun extras like different ship skins and classic Wipeout HUD designs, though I found playing Wipeout HD with the old Wipeout XL heads-up to be jarring.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5450/700348-wohd_20080927_075037.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-700348" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5450/700348-wohd_20080927_075037.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-700348"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5450/700348-wohd_20080927_075037.jpg.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Sadly, no Red Bull this time around.</figcaption></figure>The game's challenge level reinforces the old-school feel of Wipeout HD, in that it can be quite demanding. If you haven't played a Wipeout game before, get ready for a bit of a learning curve, simply because nothing really handles the way Wipeout does. The futuristic hovercraft you pilot have a floaty quality to them that can make hard turns difficult, something that's compounded by the fact that they can go fast as hell. Wipeout HD offers training wheels in the form of the Pilot Assist feature, which helps you maintain your momentum by automatically steering you away from the walls. The game also features entirely optional SIXAXIS controls, but they are beyond useless after the initial speed class.<br/><br/>If you're an experienced Wipeout player who understands the importance of judicious use of air brakes, you'll probably find the Pilot Assist feature hurts more than it helps. While I firmly believe that negotiating impossibly serpentine tracks with squirrely hovercraft at sci-fi speeds is integral to the Wipeout experience, I'm also not going to begrudge one's desire for a more accessible experience. The problem with Pilot Assist is that you can use it both online and off, and there's no way to filter online races based on whether Pilot Assist is active. You have no way of knowing if the guy that's beating you is just really good, or whether he's under the influence of performance-enhancing robots.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Wipeout HD is repetition. Eight tracks is a fine start, and a decent value for a game that's being sold for $19.99, but after running them forwards and backwards dozens of times, they can get old, though it's nothing that some DLC couldn't cure. Either way, this is more of a nostalgia trip than a reinvention of the wheel, but it's a well-produced one that might just snag a few new fans along the way.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20610/]]></api_detail_url><id>20610</id><name><![CDATA[WipEout HD]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wipeout-hd/3030-20610/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-29 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-76851/]]></api_detail_url><id>76851</id><name><![CDATA[WipEout HD]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wipeout-hd-review/1900-62/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-63/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[A unique blend of battlefield tactics and first-person shooting make Hell's Highway more interesting than its familiar WWII trappings let on.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/677123-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-677123" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.55882352941176" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/677123-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-677123"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/677123-29.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The significance of this gun won't be apparent to first-time Brothers in Arms players.</figcaption></figure>I'm as guilty as anyone for ragging on the ubiquity of World War II first-person shooters, but just because a game features an overly familiar setting doesn't make it a bad game as a matter of fact. Having not played any of the prior games in the series, I definitely came into Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway with expectations that this would just be yet another WWII first-person shooter, and was pleasantly surprised by the focus of the story and the unique and engaging squad tactics.<br/><br/>Squad dynamics are significant to Hell's Highway beyond just the gameplay, as the story of the game focuses almost entirely on the interpersonal relationships between your squad members. The game takes place during Operation Market Garden, but instead of grand and violent <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> set pieces, you get discord between officers, the burden of guilt over a soldier's death, and the resentment of being passed over for promotion. The game lays out its cinematic aspirations early on with a showy, Altman-esque tracking shot, and while there are some resonant moments, it's hindered by inconsistent voice work and characters that are difficult to distinguish visually. <br/><br/>The game also assumes that you've been following the Brothers in Arms series pretty closely, taking little time to introduce the characters or explain the events from past games, both of which end up playing significant roles in Hell's Highway. As a Brothers in Arms first-timer, I felt like I was watching the middle episode of a serialized TV series, though I think this structural choice for Hell's Highway might have actually worked to its advantage had the game come out closer to when developer Gearbox originally intended. The way it panned out, Hell's Highway is picking up the story three years after the last installment, which is less than ideal for episodic storytelling.<br/><br/>While I found the plotting in Hell's Highway a little uneven, the gameplay was incredibly engaging, largely because it's as much a strategy game as it is a first-person shooter. Playing as Staff Sgt. Matt Baker, you regularly command up to three squads of soldiers while simultaneously trying to take out some Nazis yourself. Trying to coordinate multiple groups of soldiers without getting your own ass shot off might sound daunting, but the game does an excellent job of acclimating you to its unique controls--which are themselves pretty intelligently designed--and the AI is actually pretty smart about not running headlong into obvious danger. When your men fall in battle, it's because of you, not iffy pathfinding.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/584545-930277_20080815_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-584545" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/584545-930277_20080815_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-584545"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/870/584545-930277_20080815_screen004.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Why shoot when others will do it for you?</figcaption></figure>Much emphasis is put on suppressing enemy forces with one squad, and then flanking them with another, a basic tactic that gets a lot of use over the course of the game, though with enough variation that it stays interesting. Your squads can have different specialties, such as a bazooka squad or an assault squad, and figuring out how best to use them in different situations is part of the fun.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about Hell's Highway is the fact that you can spend as much time commanding your squads as you do actually shooting enemies yourself. I've played too many first-person shooters that feature AI-controlled companions who are little more than window-dressing, and I found having the option of getting through a skirmish without firing a shot myself to be incredibly satisfying. It's also the thing that makes Hell's Highway feel a little more authentic, since the inter-reliance of soldiers is a fundamental facet of military life.<br/><br/>The game peppers in sequences where you're on your own, away from your squads. While technically competent, these weren't my favorite parts of Hell's Highway. Even then, the game's pronounced cover system kept it from feeling too terribly generic. There are a few sequences where you get to take control of a tank, which is nice for the variety, but maybe not as much fun as wreaking havoc with a tank should be. Hell's Highway also features an online multiplayer component, but it's a fairly different experience from the single-player game, one that doesn't play to the strengths of the single-player game. You're still part of a squad, though real live squadmates simply aren't as dependable. <br/><br/>Hell's Highway is a World War II first-person shooter, but it's also a lot more than that. Gearbox doesn't nail every aspect of the execution, but it's unique enough to warrant a look, even if you think you're done with WWII.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20834/]]></api_detail_url><id>20834</id><name><![CDATA[Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway/3030-20834/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-30 20:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72915/]]></api_detail_url><id>72915</id><name><![CDATA[Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway-review/1900-63/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-64/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Crysis Warhead trades the length of the original for a bit more intensity and a lot more focus.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/680355-crysisw_20080921_134633.png" data-ref-id="1300-680355" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.7998046875" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/680355-crysisw_20080921_134633.png" data-ref-id="1300-680355"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/680355-crysisw_20080921_134633.png"/></a><figcaption>This Korean dude wants the container reeeal bad-like.</figcaption></figure>Crysis Warhead is a standalone game, but you'll get more out of it if you've played Crysis. That's because it's essentially an expansion pack that you don't need the first Crysis to play, one that sets you in the role of a different character on the same island, at the same time as the events of the original game. Call it Crysis Gaiden if you like, but this side story is a shorter and more-focused take on the action found in the previous game. If the original Crysis left you wondering when the action was going to finally heat up, look no further.<br/></div><br/><div>Warhead puts you in the nanosuit of another member of your squad from the original game. Here you play as a guy with the codename of Psycho. He's essentially <a data-ref-id="3040-70379" href="/jason-statham/3040-70379" slug="jason-statham">Jason Statham</a> as Chev Chelios from <em>Crank</em> but with a crazy suit that gives him enhanced ass-kicking abilities instead of the Beijing Cocktail and the ability to have sex with Amy Smart in public.</div><br/><div>It's a toss-up, really.</div><br/><div>Anyway, the suit gives your British guy the same powers that <a data-ref-id="3005-731" href="/nomad/3005-731" slug="nomad">Nomad</a> had in the original Crysis. The standard mode is an armor mode that treats the suit's energy as a rechargeable shield, but you can also set it up for speed, strength, or a cloaking device that turns you invisible for a brief period of time. The more you move while cloaked, the more it drains, which makes it tougher to run up behind people while invisible and smoke them, so the cloaking function isn't quite as cool as it initially seems.</div><br/><div>You'll also have guns, of course, such as a few rifles, dual pistols or sub-machine guns, a shotgun, various grenades or mines, and so on. The weapons themselves aren't so great, but your ability to customize them makes up for that. You'll find additional scopes and attachments that you can apply to your weaponry at will, so if you feel like going silent you can slap on a suppressor. If discretion isn't your game, there's always a grenade launcher. Or, you know, a flashlight.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/677763-screenshot0030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-677763" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/677763-screenshot0030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-677763"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/677763-screenshot0030.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Your nanosuit lets you quickly get into or out of trouble.</figcaption></figure>Crysis Warhead gives you these tools and plops you into the jungle area of an island filled with evil North Koreans, eviler alien creatures, and somehow even eviler North Koreans. The story is set alongside the events of the original game, but it doesn't really stop to point those events out to you. If you haven't played Crysis, then you'll be left wondering why everything around the middle of the game suddenly turns to ice. And then why, after completing that section, you never see iced-over bodies of water ever again. So things are a bit easier to follow if you at least read up on the events of Crysis beforehand, but since the story doesn't really go anywhere too interesting on its own, you're probably not missing much if you ignore all that stuff.</div><br/><div>The original Crysis was a game set apart from its shooter-brethren by its attempts to create a cohesive, more-open world to play around in. Combat wasn't as frequent as it perhaps should have been, but occasionally you'd stumble onto a camp full of enemies who haven't spotted you yet, and you'd be able to sit back and devise a way to tear it apart. Warhead gives you the same options, but it's also much more linear-feeling game. You never feel like you're randomly stumbling upon encampments or other random events. You feel like you're working your way from one end of a first-person shooter level to the other. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it also tends to focus the action and firm up the pacing of the experience when compared to the original. It's also shorter, and will probably show you the ending around the six-hour mark.</div><br/><div>I enjoyed playing through Crysis Warhead, but ended up feeling like it didn't give you enough time to really savor the tools at your disposal. Shooting enemies in the face is, as you'd expect, the quickest way to do them in. So abilities like super speed and super strength end up having limited usefulness. I went back and hacked around with the game's console and cheated all to hell, ending up with infinite energy, ammo, and weapons. Obviously, that takes out all the challenge. But it also gives you time to toy around with the enemies and really explore the game's technical side. Switching to strength mode, grabbing Korean dudes by the neck, and tossing them away, for example, is one of those in-game guilty pleasures that only cheats and sandboxes can provide.</div><br/><div>Warhead also comes with a second disc with its own install process that gives you the multiplayer portion of the game, Crysis Wars. There's a new mode here that wasn't in the original Crysis, but the experience is largely the same. You shoot dudes, said dudes fall over and die. Sometimes you shoot at the shadows of dudes, since you can still see the shadows of cloaked soldiers, making the cloak almost entirely useless in most situations. It's a perfectly serviceable online shooter with decent map design, but doesn't really stand out to me in any way beyond the game's trademark visuals.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/680480-crysis2008092122442925zc9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-680480" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/680480-crysis2008092122442925zc9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-680480"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/680480-crysis2008092122442925zc9.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/680480-crysis2008092122442925zc9.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Dual pistols make the world go 'round.</figcaption></figure>Oh, right, those. Remember how Crysis is still sort of the best-looking game ever made? Warhead looks like that, provided you turn the settings up. The game has supposedly been optimized a bit to run better on lesser machines, but it can still be a beast if you want to turn it up all the way. The game has an auto-detect function that will look at your system and set itself up accordingly, but it seems out of touch with reality. Here are the basic specs of my machine:</div><br/><div><ul class="plain-list"><li>Vista SP1</li> <li>2GB RAM</li> <li>Geforce 8800</li> <li>Quad Core 2.4Ghz CPU</li> </ul> </div><br/><div>The game defaulted to "mainstream" on this hardware. I can't even figure out what that's supposed to mean. The game has default settings marked minimum, mainstream, gamer, and enthusiast. This makes no sense, but given the order they appear in the dropdown, I've taken it to mean that minimum is, like, minimum. And enthusiast must be "stupid dope greatest graphics ever" mode or something. When I flicked everything up to "gamer," textures started disappearing left and right, leaving me with enemies that had a flat shade of gray where their face and skin should be. Mainstream looked decent and had a great frame rate, even at 1680x1050. But the level of detail distance on that setting is criminally low, and caused me to miss a few items here and there because they weren't being drawn when they were more than, like, 20 feet away from me. Sing this along with me: Your Mileage May Vary!</div><br/><div>One of the best parts about Crysis Warhead is the price. With an expansion-minded retail rate of $29.99, Crysis Warhead is inexpensive enough to make many of its issues feel very minor. Taken with the optimizations that may make it a friendlier game on more hardware configurations and its action-focused pacing, it's also much more approachable than the previous game.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21230/]]></api_detail_url><id>21230</id><name><![CDATA[Crysis Warhead]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/crysis-warhead/3030-21230/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-09-30 23:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-74491/]]></api_detail_url><id>74491</id><name><![CDATA[Crysis Warhead]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/crysis-warhead-review/1900-64/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PC]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-65/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Fracture offers a future where our best hope for survival relies on making enemies walk uphill.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">Well, here we are. Cybernetic Al Gore is dancing an I-told-you-so jig as global warming has caused the rising sea levels to envelop the entire United States. Luckily, with the help of terrain-deforming technology, we were able to elevate and save most of the Blue States, but the middle of America was flooded by an ocean of sadness. This essentially cleaved the US in two, and since water is a barrier which neither man nor idea dare cross, we have become a nation divided and have set to war.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">The actual back story in Fracture details how the Pacificans (West Coasters) chose to augment their bodies by way of genetics, while the Atlantic Alliance (East Coasters) chose to alter themselves using cybernetics. Of course, this causes all sorts of trouble, and since the seat of government still resides in the East, the Atlantic Alliance says a big HELL NO to genetics (and Fat Burger), thus causing the Pacificans to secede from the union. In the game, you'll jump into the shoes of Jet Brody, a special unit with the Atlantic Alliance, intent on stopping this nefarious rebellion.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/266879-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-266879" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/266879-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-266879"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4086/266879-9.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Making enemies climb out of holes really annoys them.</figcaption></figure>You might as well be fighting an invading army of aliens from the amount that all this actually works its way into the game. You'll be running around fighting a bunch of guys that look and sound more like Halo cosplayers than genetically enhanced supersoldiers. You also won't find yourself morally torn, debating the role of government versus freewill. Actually, the biggest question you'll probably have is “Who the hell sent me out here with only a gun that raises and lowers the friggin' ground?” <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">That's right: Terrain deformation is the mechanic du jour here, and your special weapon, the entrencher, will enable you to raise and lower terrain to your heart's (or the engine's) content. The idea is that being able to manipulate the terrain can give or strip away cover, giving you a huge advantage during firefights, during which you will be grossly outnumbered. The fundamental problem I found with this is that while you can certainly create a mountain of cover to shield you from incoming fire, you'll still have to either go around or lower it to shoot at your enemy. Without an easy way to pop in and out of your newly made cover you are continually exposing yourself to a barrage of pinpoint accurate enemy fire. This works the same way when you eliminate cover from your enemies and you suddenly find yourself in a “oh, hello there bullets!” situation. </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">You'll also find grenades which can raise or lower the ground, much like your entrencher. The unfortunate part here is that your enemies have also found them, and will constantly use them to destroy both your cover and you. While all this tearing up of the ground and cover adds a very hectic pace to the battles, it can also make them frustrating and you'll probably find yourself seeking more permanent shelter than your entrencher can build for you. While you'll also be using the entrencher to solve some puzzles here and there, its most useful application is also probably its most mundane: simply reaching higher ledges. It's a shame more couldn't be done to make the terrain deformation mechanic more useful and rewarding on the battefield. </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">Aside from your entrecher, you'll be able to carry your choice of two other guns. While there are more than a few options to pick up, I found that--either due to limited ammo or range constraints--there were only two or three I could rely on. In addition to your weapons you'll be granted a couple of enhancements every few levels, from your loving team back home. Some of these include a more powerful melee attack, stronger shields and the ability to jump higher. While these are probably the most helpful things you're given throughout the game, they also make you wonder why in the world headquarters just doesn't give you them all at the start? </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/266881-11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-266881" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/266881-11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-266881"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4086/266881-11.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The physics are actually pretty dang fun at times.</figcaption></figure>The game consists of three acts spread over eleven missions. While the game itself can be reasonably lengthy, a lot of that time will come from replaying the same battles over and over. Even on normal difficulty you'll find that the game can be brutal, with swarms of enemies bombarding you from every angle. Once you've finally managed to overcome your last foe in a given encounter you'll enter into the next area where you'll have to do it all again. This kind of staggered, battle to battle pacing, combined with the relative lack of variety in the enemies, can make the game begin to drag in the latter missions. <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">The game looks sharp, aside from a lack of variety in the units and levels. The music is maybe a little too Lucas for its own good, suited more for lightsabers and cracking whips than post-apocalyptic terrain deformation, but is solid nonetheless. The terraforming effects all look good and animate well and after a frantic battle the surrounding area will look appropriately torn up. The physics in the game are also well done, allowing you to take advantage of precariously placed explosive barrels and other objects strewn throughout the environment. Even still, a solid presentation and decent physics engine can only do so much to buffer you from the repetitive and frustrating battles that are the core of the game. </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; ">The multiplayer offers up much of the same in terms of gameplay, though this time there is even less use for the entrencher since humans over three years old rarely find themselves baffled when you vanish behind cover. You'll be capturing flags and doing free-for-alls in a pretty standard fashion. The heavy reliance on the weapons over terrain deformation makes it a little too vanilla to set it apart from other games, though.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><span>While the game itself is technically proficient, nothing about the gameplay pushes it above and beyond that base level of proficiency</span>. Its biggest problem comes from a clever premise with poor implementation. There's some replay value here in the multiplayer and the collection of data cells, which unlock the weapons from the campaign in a weapons testing area, but even those can get old very quickly. Once you get past the limited use of the terrain deformation you'll find yourself searching for anything new or exciting in Fracture's take on the sci-fi third-person shooter.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p> <p style="margin-bottom:0in; "><br/> </p>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20516/]]></api_detail_url><id>20516</id><name><![CDATA[Fracture]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/fracture/3030-20516/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-10-15 19:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-77704/]]></api_detail_url><id>77704</id><name><![CDATA[Fracture]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Vinny]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/fracture-review/1900-65/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-66/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[This amusing trifle of a platformer benefits from its vivid presentation.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/302808-wario_land_shake_it__040.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-302808" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/302808-wario_land_shake_it__040.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-302808"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/302808-wario_land_shake_it__040.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Exit, stage left!</figcaption></figure>If I were to fill out one of those awful MySpace personality quizzes that determine which Nintendo character you're most like, I like to think I'd be <a data-ref-id="3005-24" href="/wario/3005-24" slug="wario">Wario</a>. Despite his origins as a cheap <span>Bizarro</span> Mario meant to serve as a <a data-ref-id="3005-337" href="/bowser/3005-337" slug="bowser">Bowser</a> stand-in on the Game Boy, Wario has since been fleshed out as one of Nintendo's most distinct and interesting personalities. While his involvement in the ADD non-sequitur twitch-fest <a data-ref-id="3025-220" href="/warioware/3025-220" slug="warioware">WarioWare</a> games doesn't hurt, it's his moral ambiguity and pathological self-interest amongst a peer group of cutesy family-friendly goody-goodies that make him particularly compelling. Also, he's a crazy, ugly garlic-man with an old-timey prospector's cackling obsession with treasure who has been known to weaponize his farts. So, there's that.<br/><br/>Wario Land: Shake It!, his latest adventure on the Wii, builds on the basic formula of past <a data-ref-id="3025-600" href="/wario-land/3025-600" slug="wario-land">Wario Land</a> games. Since we haven't seen one of those since the launch of the Game Boy Advance back in 2001, it's OK if you've never heard of them, though suffice it to say that the Wario Land series has avoided comparisons to Mario's platforming adventures by focusing on gadgety puzzles and serpentine level designs. Shake It! adds some perfunctory motion controls to the mix, though its best feature is easily its all-new 2D graphics, which sport big, crisp characters and a level of detail that make you wish more games would invest their technical and artistic prowess into sprite-based presentation.<br/><br/>Shake It! operates under a suitably ridiculous and largely superfluous yarn about a parallel “shake dimension,” a realm whose queen has been imprisoned by the aptly named Shake King. Given the heads-up on the whole situation, as well as a magical globe and telescope, by <span>Captain Maple Syrup</span>, Wario plunges into the shake dimension, less at the desperate pleas of the queen, more for the Shake King's bottomless coin bag.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/181862-7_wariolandshake_ss15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181862" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.67655367231638" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:67.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/181862-7_wariolandshake_ss15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181862"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/181862-7_wariolandshake_ss15.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Cutscenes like this give the sense that you're watching some unreleased Wario cartoon.</figcaption></figure>The world is divided up into five maps, each of which contain a half-dozen or so individual stages. The stages generally conform to a basic formula that sees Wario working his way through pitfalls and enemy patrols to rescue a little glowing pixie. Prisoner in tow, Wario then has to back to the start before a countdown timer hits zero. Wario definitely isn't as nimble as his blue-and-red counterpart, but he makes up for it in power and ingenuity. Wario can smash through rock walls and wooden crates with a running dash attack, perform a very sturdy butt-stomp, and toss enemies around like he was Yoshi. He also makes use of goofy unicycle contraptions, as well as a device known as the Max Fastosity Dasherator, which allows him to dash indefinitely, so long as he doesn't encounter any immovable objects. This gadget is particularly crucial in finding hidden areas and secret shortcuts during the backtracking parts. It's fundamentally a pretty clever platformer that takes its time ramping up the difficulty, while still requiring you to consider all of Wario's moves when confronted with an obstacle.<br/><br/>All that nonsense about the shake dimension at the start of the game plays into the action with a handful of waggle-based moves that Wario can perform. A quick shake of the Wii Remote performs a ground-pound move that will stun nearby enemies and triggers certain objects. If you grab a stunned enemy, you can shake the controller to either knock a life-replenishing bulb of garlic out of them, or rattle off any armor they're wearing. You'll find coin sacks throughout the game which you can shake to empty in a similar fashion. The most sophisticated bit of motion control in Shake It! involves tilting the Wii Remote to aim your shot when you've got a stunned enemy or other projectile in hand. It works well enough, though it's also sort of telling that, at this point in the Wii's lifespan, a game that uses the system's most gimmicky features sparingly is considered merciful.<br/><br/>In addition to the basic stage-to-stage progression, each stage is home to a few different pieces of hidden treasure to collect, as well as a number of performance-based side missions, which often require Wario to collect a certain amount of money, avoid falling in water or taking damage, or taking out a specific type of enemy. Most of these hidden treasures and side missions require previous knowledge of a stage, and many of them can only be done during the backtracking part. You'll find some side missions to be contradictory with one another, making it impossible to collect everything on a single run-through. The game is pretty clever, but not clever enough to mitigate the irritation of playing through a level a second time around, only to botch a side mission at the last moment.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/181898-13_wariolandshake_ss39.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181898" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/181898-13_wariolandshake_ss39.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181898"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/181898-13_wariolandshake_ss39.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/181898-13_wariolandshake_ss39.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Cash Rules Everything Around Wario.</figcaption></figure> This type of repetition is fostered elsewhere in Wario Land: Shake It!. While your access to stages within a map is determined by your completion of the previous stage, you have to throw down some cash before you can access the next map after playing through the previous one. Chances are, you'll reach a point before you hit the fifth and final map where you don't have enough scratch to buy the next map, requiring you to go back and grind out some more money on a previous stage. Each stage can be engaging enough the first few times through, but at a point it just gets tedious.<br/><br/>Even when the game starts to get a little old, it's a pleasure to look at. Wario in particular is a showcase of great 2D animation. It looks great when he shakes something so fast it turns into a blur, or the way he dives head-first into warp pipes, wiggling his hindquarters to make his way through. The bosses are often rich with detail as well. I also like the way Wario Land: Shake It! sounds. Wario's nasal cackle has long been one of my favorite of his character traits, and the game features an insane soundtrack that swings between blippy 8-bit tracks, guitar rock, and the kind of Japanese smooth-jazz that wouldn't be out of place in a <span> mahjong</span> game.<br/><br/>For as many times as I had to replay certain stages, Wario Land: Shake It! felt kind of brief, though there were aspects that managed to wear out their welcome before it was over. Still, a 2D game with this kind of detail is enough of an anomaly that it can be enjoyable for that alone, and despite some structural issues, it shakes up the usual platformer formula enough to be interesting.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20963/]]></api_detail_url><id>20963</id><name><![CDATA[Wario Land: Shake It!]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wario-land-shake-it/3030-20963/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-10-16 20:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73522/]]></api_detail_url><id>73522</id><name><![CDATA[Wario Land: Shake It!]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wario-land-shake-it-review/1900-66/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-67/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Age of Booty's multiplayer is great fun that keeps you coming back, but you'll need a solid crew who wants to work together if you want to dominate the opposition.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/334/624438-plunder_screen_003_map_editor.png" data-ref-id="1300-624438" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/334/624438-plunder_screen_003_map_editor.png" data-ref-id="1300-624438"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/334/624438-plunder_screen_003_map_editor.png"/></a><figcaption>Apparently the inspiration for Age of Booty came from the running "Pimps at Sea" gag that Bungie rolls out from time to time.</figcaption></figure>If you've been following <a data-ref-id="2300-46" href="/age-of-booty-preview-ish/2300-46" slug="age-of-booty-preview-ish">the coverage</a> we've done on the site, you've already seen that Age of Booty appears to be a fun game when played with friends and acquaintances in a local match. But those circumstances--hooking up multiple boxes in the same room to ensure that all trash-talking occurs in a face-to-face setting--aren't likely to be duplicated by most people out there. So I was left wondering how Age of Booty would hold up under more "normal" or "sober" settings. The answer remains mostly the same: Certain Affinity's single-unit real-time strategy game is a well-designed one, with plenty to offer players who want to team up and plunder towns over Xbox Live while fighting off rival pirates and occasionally shouting "yarr."<br/></div><br/><div>Age of Booty is, really, pretty simple. You control a pirate ship, usually on a team with other pirates, and you're up against one or more opposing teams. Your goal is to win the map, which is done by either capturing a set number of towns or holding the most towns when time expires. Towns are taken by force with the cannons on you and your teammates' ships. Taking towns can also get you resources, which are used to upgrade your ships or your towns, making them harder for the enemy to capture.</div><br/><div>That's the back and forth of Age of Booty. While the towns start out neutral, all the teams are going to be scrambling to take and re-take them until a victor is declared. So deciding when to hang back and defend your existing towns and deciding when (and where) to push forward makes the game nicely strategic. But it's also fast-paced, so you don't have a ton of time to think before you act.</div><br/><div>That's why it's nice that the controls are really simple to understand. You do most things using only one button that controls the movement of your ship. The hex-based map makes it easy to determine your attack range--you'll attack anything worth shooting at if you're one hex away from it. If you've got two targets next to you, you'll split your fire, which makes pinching your enemies between two pirate ships or a ship and a town or something like that a totally key strategy. The only time you'll use other buttons are if you need to quickly scroll around the map or spend your resources on an upgrade.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3484/236945-945392_20080715_screen013.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236945" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.6" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:160.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3484/236945-945392_20080715_screen013.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236945"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3484/236945-945392_20080715_screen013.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The game tries to give the AI characters a bit of... well... character, but they don't do a great job in practice.</figcaption></figure>When you look at Age of Booty's online setup, it's easy to see that Certain Affinity, the game's developer, was started by a group of ex-Bungie employees. Rather than the typical ranked/unranked split that most 360 games have, you can either jump into standardized playlists or set up a private game. You can get some friends together and all jump into a game as a party, as well. It's easy to pick up and makes getting into a game pretty fast.</div><br/><div>You can also set up matches with AI-controlled bots, and the game has a set of single-player challenges that team you up with some AI guys, as well. This stuff is functional, but perhaps disappointing when compared to the multiplayer. Since there's an extreme need to cooperate with the other members of your team, you're sort of stuck following the AI teammates around, since you can't order them around and they rarely seem to come back you up or play with any sort of meaningful intelligence. Once you've gotten the hang of the controls in a few single-player games, you'll probably get online and never look back.</div><br/><div>Age of Booty also has a well-implemented map editor that lets you create different sizes and fill up the maps with anything you find on the official levels. Once you create a map, you can take it online in private games. Any created maps that you encounter are automatically saved to a list of recent maps, where you can decide if you want to store them permanently or not. Also, Certain Affinity seems to have already released two new official maps, which download automatically when you fire up the editor. All things considered, it's a surprisingly deep feature to find in a downloadable game that seems to be implemented a bit better than the N+ custom levels were.</div><br/><div>It's easy to hear the words "console" and "real-time strategy" in the same sentence and immediately determine that Age of Booty is not for you. But the game really feels like it was built with the constraints of the average gamepad in mind while simultaneously not feeling dumbed-down or stripped. If you've got some rowdy friends, or if you're willing to take a chance online and try to meet some rowdy strangers, Age of Booty's multiplayer is well worth checking out.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20564/]]></api_detail_url><id>20564</id><name><![CDATA[Age of Booty]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/age-of-booty/3030-20564/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-10-17 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-76295/]]></api_detail_url><id>76295</id><name><![CDATA[Age of Booty]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/age-of-booty-review/1900-67/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-68/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[The game is much greater than the sum of its familiar parts.

I know I was guilty of doing it. But in our defense, you <em>have</em> seen all this before: A massive, grungy industrial starship gone dark, adrift in a remote system with no sign of its crew. A horde of hideous monsters spewing forth from a sinister, amorphous biomass hiding deep within the ship. Audio and text logs scattered around every deck that reveal what happened, piece by piece. An over-the-shoulder perspective that snaps to a zoomed-in aiming view for combat.<br /><br /><a data-ref-id="3030-14537" href="/doom-3/3030-14537">Doom 3</a>, check. <a data-ref-id="3030-8870" href="/system-shock-2/3030-8870">System Shock 2</a>, check. <a data-ref-id="3030-12231" href="/gears-of-war/3030-12231">Gears of War</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-1578" href="/resident-evil-4/3030-1578">Resident Evil 4</a>, check.<br /><br />But all those blatant similarities didn't matter in the end. After finishing it, I felt stupid about knocking Dead Space for displaying its influences so prominently, because this game is pretty darn amazing.<br /><br />The story isn't astoundingly original, but it does a fine job of moving you from one section of the ship to the next. You take the role of deep-space mining engineer <a data-ref-id="3005-1197" href="/isaac-clarke/3005-1197">Isaac Clarke</a>, a member of a five-man crew dispatched to investigate the loss of contact with the <a data-ref-id="3035-1678" href="/usg-ishimura/3035-1678">USG Ishimura</a>, an enormous "planetcracker" mining ship. Clarke's girlfriend was stationed on the Ishimura, so he has personal as well as professional reasons for getting in there and finding out what's going on. About five minutes after arriving, Clarke's own ship is toast, his five-man crew is down to three, and those three have been separated by a vile menagerie of creatures overrunning nearly every inch of the ship. Over the course of the game's 12 roughly hour-long chapters, your priorities will shift from saving the Ishimura to saving your own ass, and you'll barely fight your way through one tense, frantic monster attack after another as you try to escape the ship. The game is densely packed with spectacular moments from beginning to end, and the action is paced well enough that you never get bored <em>or</em> feel overwhelmed at any given moment.<br /><br />It's easy to forgive a game for being derivative when it's presented with so much impact and it plays so damn well. Dead Space has some of the tightest, most well-balanced controls I've ever used in this kind of game. There are so many variables in a third-person shooter that contribute to the way it feels--the camera speed, the sensitivity of the analog sticks, the interval between hitting the aiming-mode trigger and actually being able to fire a gun--and I can't complain about any one of these factors in Dead Space; they all feel sublimely tuned and perfectly balanced to be easy to use and, above all, <em>fun</em>. You can hold a shoulder button to run, but unlike Gears' famed <a data-ref-id="3015-1872" href="/roadie-running/3015-1872">roadie run</a>, you can still stop on a dime and break into a sidestep in an instant (or even run backwards). Everything about the moving, aiming, and shooting controls is superbly balanced and really entertaining.<br /><br /><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4387/212166-screen_controlconsole_download_022708.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-212166" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4387/212166-screen_controlconsole_download_022708.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-212166"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4387/212166-screen_controlconsole_download_022708.jpg"/></a><figcaption>A sense of dread permeates every deck of the Ishimura.</figcaption></figure>EA has been throwing around the catchy marketing phrase "<a data-ref-id="3015-418" href="/strategic-dismemberment/3015-418">strategic dismemberment</a>" in reference to Dead Space for a few months now, which is justifiable since that's actually a good way to describe the combat. Most of the game's grotesquely mutated enemies have spindly arms, legs, tentacles, and other appendages that you can shoot off with a well-placed shot or two, and you get these satisfyingly meaty snapping sounds and a jet of blood every time you separate another body part. You can also stomp an enemy that's down but not out with your heavy spacesuit boots to splatter their limbs before they can get back up and keep coming at you. And I do mean splatter--it's a really gory game.<br /><br />The precision aiming required to properly dismember the enemies adds more depth to the combat than you'd get with most shooters, where you're just pumping rounds into a guy's torso or, at most, aiming for his head. Here, you'll want to specifically shoot for the knee to stop a fast-running monster from chasing you down, or shear off one of the smaller types of enemies' tentacles because they can fire spikes with them. The game's basic pistol weapon, the plasma cutter, even lets you orient its wide beam vertically or horizontally for more accurate slicing and dicing. Another weapon, the ripper, shoots a saw blade about eight feet in front of you and then just holds it spinning in midair, letting you rake it over an enemy and slice them up every which way. You can imagine the possibilities. With eight weapons on the roster and an alternate fire mode for each, there's a lot of variety in the carnage here.<br /><br />Dead Space throws in a few more mechanics above the basic shooting action. You can telekinetically pick up and launch some objects as weapons, and you can also throw a stasis field to slow down an enemy briefly, making it easier to take their limbs off with precision. Both of these abilities are useful in fairly frequent environmental puzzles, some of them simple and some clever. I liked that the game didn't try to portray Isaac as a mining engineer...who also happens to have psionic abilities. Both of these abilities stem from devices in his suit, and that's that. <br /><br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4340/436962-943338_20071203_screen018.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-436962" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4340/436962-943338_20071203_screen018.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-436962"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4340/436962-943338_20071203_screen018.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4340/436962-943338_20071203_screen018.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The superb visuals demand a nice big television.</figcaption></figure>Lastly, there are some noteworthy sequences in zero gravity and in a vacuum (sometimes both). The vacuum sequences don't play any differently--they just feel more urgent, since they put you on a timer as your air tank runs out--but they dramatically desaturate the color palette and dampen the sound almost entirely, which creates a uniquely eerie atmosphere, especially when you're clomping along with your magnetic boots on the outside of the ship and some monsters silently sneak up behind you and attack. In the zero-G sections, those boots keep you planted while everything else floats freely, and you can jump from any one flat surface to another. So every wall becomes a potential floor and you never really know which way is up. It's a refreshingly confusing approach to weightlessness that creates some interesting puzzle scenarios.<br /><br />This is a game you really need to play on a big high-def TV with a good, bass-heavy sound system. It's an audiovisual tour de force, with some of the moodiest and most impressive lighting effects on this generation of consoles. Some of the interior environments of the <span>Ishimura</span> are positively cavernous, or filled with massive thrumming machinery. There aren't a lot of boss encounters, but the sheer scale of a couple of them in particular left my jaw hanging open. The sound design is also extremely well done, not just for the ever-present creepy ambient backdrop, but also some of the in-your-face effects, like Isaac's sonorous gasping when he's badly hurt and out of breath, or that aforementioned grisly wet crunch of severed monster limbs. The sound effects have a real weight to them that beg to be conveyed over speakers with some serious muscle.<br /><br />Dead Space would be a great game no matter who made it, but I'm more impressed with it since it's coming out of EA. That bastion of the annualized sequel is finally taking some risks with original games, if not always original ideas, and in this case the risk paid huge dividends. You've probably seen most of Dead Space's parts in other games from time to time, but you've rarely seen them assembled this well.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20800/]]></api_detail_url><id>20800</id><name><![CDATA[Dead Space]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/dead-space/3030-20800/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-10-20 18:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72742/]]></api_detail_url><id>72742</id><name><![CDATA[Dead Space]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Brad]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dead-space-review/1900-68/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PC]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-69/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Fable II keeps you thoroughly entertained whether you're saving the world or unraveling it.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Albion, the fantasy realm where heroes do battle with deadly blades and fearsome magics, and the best protection comes not from a shield but rather a steadfast condom. It's a land set adrift in a sea of nonsense and you've got your hand on the rudder. This is the world of Fable II, and the choices you make here will provide hours of entertainment, granted you can get past some minor technical issues.<br/><br/></p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11663-Poser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11663" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56328125" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11663-Poser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11663"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11663-Poser.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The world of Albion is yours to shape as you see fit.</figcaption></figure>Fable II opens with you as a young, impoverished orphan. Accompanied only by your sister's plucky attitude and a wooden sword to fend off starvation, you quickly find yourself performing quests for gold coins. Without giving too much away, your destiny to save the world comes at some fairly high costs, not the least of which is the sudden end of your childhood. It's a fairly short sequence, and you'll find yourself in the throes of adulthood soon enough, yet even the choices made here will echo into the future. From the very first scene where you're christened by bird poop until well after the credits you will be making moral choices that affect not only you, but the world around you as well. <br/><br/>It's these choices that are really at the heart of Fable II. At the game's most fundamental level you'll be constantly choosing between good and evil, but rarely will it feel as sterile as that. The choices are usually couched in some sort of ambiguity, with the consequences remaining a mystery for years. That's right, years! The game will span more than a few by the time you're finished, but even though there are day and night cycles, the big jumping points are clearly marked, so don't worry about taking your time. Also, be prepared to commit for the long haul if you want to be a saint. While running into a town and starting a massacre will turn you evil in mere minutes, it may take you the majority of the game to tread the road to righteousness. It seems like being good requires a pretty strict commitment, both in playing style and in actual sacrifices.<br/><br/>The best part about all this heavy decision-making is that the game rarely takes itself very seriously. While the choices certainly have weight to them, the world's inhabitants are so ridiculous that it's hard to not derive some pleasure no matter how things break. Yes, towns will prosper and despair by your hand, but everybody seems to be having a good time of it, regardless. If you're playing as a nice guy you'll be swarmed by loving fans seeking autographs or marriage proposals,  or generally wanting to bask in your light. If you're a big meanie, you'll feel the scorn of the townsfolk. A couple of jerks even took it upon themselves to kick my dog. They are dead now.<br/><br/>Your dog is actually one of the few constants you'll have throughout Fable II. He'll run around with you throughout your adventures, alerting you to treasure and biting your foes once they've hit the ground. You can name him, teach him tricks and he'll even change in appearance, much as you do, as your alignment alters. That being said, I didn't find myself bursting into tears every time he nicked his paw but realized that we had a good working relationship. I feed him treats to heal him and he tells me where to find treasure. Though we did find common ground when it came to laughing and urinating on things.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11661-Dad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11661" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11661-Dad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11661"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11661-Dad.jpg"/></a><figcaption>No, you can't kill children, but you can scare the crap out of them!</figcaption></figure>Aside from the sweeping, moral choices you'll be making throughout the game, there are many more subtle interactions that will probably take up just as much time. There's an economy to the land of Albion and you can participate by buying up homes and businesses. You'll receive income from any business you invest in as well as any home you rent out. You can also make some cash doing a few odd jobs, but since you'll constantly be getting new influxes of real-estate cash every five minutes of playtime, you can leave the manual labor to the chumps. In fact, you'll even collect rent and other income while the game is turned off, based on how much time has passed. Needless to say, money (and ways to cheat the system) are not hard to come by.<br/><br/>If running a business and saving the world weren't enough, there's also an entire social aspect to the world. While people will eagerly blab your ear off with all sorts of chattering, apparently your hero opts to respond only in pantomime. You'll dance, flip-off, fart, growl, and pose your way in or out of the hearts of hundreds of different townspeople, each with their own likes and dislikes. You can also buy them gifts, but with the population thinking the sun rises and sets by your thumbs-up, it's hardly worth the investment. I guess if you've been slaughtering a town and would like to turn over a new leaf, a couple of chocolates couldn't hurt, but you'd be surprised how quickly a jig can turn that frown upside down.<br/><br/>Once you've charmed the pants off someone, you'll be able to settle down and start a family. There are plenty of choices for a mate here, as illustrated by their descriptors: Romantic, Cheerful, Serious, Lesbian. Once you've found love you can opt to have protected (if you're packing some rubber) or unprotected sex. While the worst thing protected sex can lead to is an awkward morning after, unprotected sex can leave you with a check in the STD column and a baby crib next to your bed. For the most part you'll just visit the crib, but later in the game you may find yourself with an actual walking, talking little townie. Talk about pressure! The marriage system is actually kind of harsh and I had more than a few wives walk out on me for no apparent reason. Once a wife divorces you and leaves the area she is considered dead, and the child is taken away from you. I guess I should be fair and say two wives actually did die. One by banshee attack and one by axe-to-the-back-of-the-head-don't-you-leave-me attack.<br/><br/>Flippant wives are actually the least of the technical woes plaguing Fable II. The menus and interface are poorly suited for all of the things you'll be juggling at any given time. While instant travel between quest areas and towns is easily accomplished by clicking on that area's name, finding shops, family members and even your own house can be a chore. The map system is woefully underdeveloped and you'll only be able to get waypoints to quest objectives. Managing and using items from your inventory can be just as cumbersome. There is no indication as to whether or not you own a particular item while you are shopping as well as no way to tell if what you're about to buy is worse than what you have. On top of that, your inventory itself is no joy to sift through and seems to get bogged down once you've collected a fair amount of items. While all of this definitely detracts from Fable II, there's enough going on to keep you entertained in the world instead of constantly being burdened by menus. <br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9532/272734-e3c01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272734" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.73553719008264" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:73.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9532/272734-e3c01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272734"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9532/272734-e3c01.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9532/272734-e3c01.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Getting that store discount can take some persuading.</figcaption></figure>You'll be engaging in a fair share of combat during the game and even with its simplified controls it all feels rewarding. Hits seem to hit big, and you'll send foes into the air, into walls, and plummeting off of walkways. You'll have your choice of melee, ranged, or magical attacks, but the most fun comes from seamlessly switching between all three. Putting a few bullets in advancing opponents and then quickly whipping out your axe to finish them off is really satisfying. The action is relatively fast and you'll be treated to some slow-motion cutaways for the bigger hits, which are always more entertaining than annoying. With the ability to drop experience into each area of attack, you'll find that there are enough changes over time to keep things interesting.<br/><br/>The biggest thing Fable II has going for it is probably its M rating. While the jokes, choices and dialogue are all smart and rather sharp at times, they are made even more entertaining given the backdrop of this childlike fantasy world. You'll come across stone gargoyle heads that you can destroy to collect treasure, but these particular heads will curse you out and mock you, which makes shooting them oh-so-satisfying. Marrying Kristen is cute; marrying Kristen the Whore, who is a bisexual prostitute and was later killed by an accidentally summoned banshee, is truly memorable. While the main plot in Fable II has some great characters, it's probably not going to stick in your mind for too long. Now, eating five baby chicks to join a dark cult...that has staying power.<br/><br/>The game also has co-op, both online and local. While it might sound fun on paper to have a friend join you on your adventures, it really seems to do the game, and the overall experience, a disservice. Your friend will only be able to join you as a premade character--dubbed a henchman--and you will both share the same view and camera controls. This leads to frustrating camera angels, and requires both players to stay in pretty close proximity. In addition to the limitations on movement, the second player will also be unable to interact with much of the world, reducing them to an extra hand during combat. The time I spent with the co-op seemed to strip away a lot of the charm and joy that I found playing in single-player, and appears to be more a novelty than anything of substance.<br/><br/>Fable II comes packed to the gills with content to keep you busy. While there are definitely some issues with the user interface and the occasional NPC freak-out, they are easy to stagger past whilst getting drunk on the fanciful world of Albion. After you've beaten the main quest, you can go back and finish up side missions, find collectibles, or better yet, start a new character and make totally different choices. With its peculiar blend of charm and dark humor, Fable II is an adventure that will leave you with your own unique tales to tell.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20514/]]></api_detail_url><id>20514</id><name><![CDATA[Fable II]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/fable-ii/3030-20514/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-10-21 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72435/]]></api_detail_url><id>72435</id><name><![CDATA[Fable II]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Vinny]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/fable-ii-review/1900-69/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-70/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Saints Row 2 ups the ante for the volume of sheer absurdity in an open-world action game.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10283/219001-939458_20080714_screen006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219001" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10283/219001-939458_20080714_screen006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219001"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10283/219001-939458_20080714_screen006.jpg"/></a><figcaption>One of many blinged-out looks you can give the Saints.</figcaption></figure>The original Saints Row didn't always benefit from comparisons to the Grand Theft Auto series, though with Saints Row 2, it's apparent that the two franchises are going in two very different directions. As much as it is a sequel to Saints Row, this is the logical extension of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, more so than GTA IV, and not just because of the similar street-gang premise. <br/><br/>The game picks up several years after the end of Saints Row, where your character was apparently blown up in a boat explosion. You wake up from your coma with a new face and with the city of <a data-ref-id="3035-161" href="/stilwater/3035-161" slug="stilwater">Stilwater</a> being overtaken by the oppressive <span>Ultor</span> Corporation, which has turned the gritty Saints Row area into a quasi-futuristic glass-and-steel paragon of corporate greed. The rest of the game focuses on you getting the Saints back together, taking down the other gangs of Stilwater, and eventually, Ultor itself. <br/><br/>Aside from the appearance of a few returning characters, Saints Row 2 doesn't really bother to resolve anything from the first game, which makes its overly familiar references to past characters and events that much more confusing. There's a fair amount of celebrity stunt-casting in Saints Row 2, which can make it difficult to separate the character from the actor. This was most noticeable for me with <a data-ref-id="3040-3246" href="/michael-dorn/3040-3246" slug="michael-dorn">Michael Dorn</a> as the insane biker <span>Maero</span>, though I won't deny getting a kick out of going up against a dude who sounds like <span>Worf</span>.<br/><br/>While GTA IV strove for dramatic weight and verisimilitude, Saints Row 2 instead tries to pack in as many ridiculous activities as possible. The main missions concern you with taking out rival gangs, and while this can be as simple as wasting a building full of dudes, sometimes you'll have to blow up the building itself, or at least fly a helicopter into it. To take on these primary missions, you've got to have a certain respect level, which you can build up quickly by taking on the occasional side mission. These can include performing insurance fraud by taking a dive in front of a moving car, lowering property values by spraying sewage, running drugs, protecting prostitutes, impersonating an officer, and riding a flaming ATV through the city streets, setting off explosions. <br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/180955-el_train_explosion01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-180955" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/180955-el_train_explosion01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-180955"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1550/180955-el_train_explosion01.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Take that, mass transit!</figcaption></figure>There are are also some ridiculous diversions, such as streaking, basejumping, anonymous bathroom sex, and car surfing. Not all of these side activities are winners, but there's enough variety that you're never stuck grinding on an activity you don't much care for. In a different context, a good amount of the stuff you can do in Saints Row 2 would seem fundamentally abhorrent, but the florid visuals and campy tone neutralize any potential for seriousness. <br/><br/>You'll earn some scratch running these missions, though real estate is the best way to build your fortune. You'll gain turf as you take out your enemies, and you can also buy an interest in any shops in your territory. These investments pay back dividends on a daily basis, and it doesn't take long for them to start racking up, to the point that money isn't much of a concern at all.<br/><br/>You can eventually take over the entirety of Stilwater, but Saints Row 2 is less concerned with creating a living, breathing world than it is with providing you with a giant sandbox to go nuts in, and the character creation is pretty indicative of this mindset. You can choose from a number of different fighting styles and elaborate rude gestures, and there's no stopping you from mixing male and female body parts and wardrobe. If you're at all unhappy with how your character's looking, you can drop into one of several plastic surgeons and change everything. You can also customize the look of the Saints with some pretty absurd results, and there's no denying the stupid appeal of seeing a half-naked man in a safety vest and a mosquito mascot mask rolling around with a gang of ninjas.<br/><br/>For all its shaggy, kitchen-sink charm, Saints Row 2 has got some problems, many of which are residue from its predecessor. The original Saints Row was partially impressive simply because it was the first real open-world game on this generation of consoles, but it's now two years later and Saints Row 2 doesn't look a whole lot better. The city of Stilwater is expansive and full of little details and secret areas to discover, but the draw distance isn't always great, and there's something about the lighting that leaves the game looking kind of flat. The frame rate mostly holds up, though there was a mission where I had to defend a large ship against waves of helicopters and boats full of dudes, and the combination of smoke effects and general activity brought the game to its knees. It can be a little buggy with the artificial intelligence, physics, and collision-detection systems, but to its credit, Saints Row 2 is liberal enough with checkpoints during missions that you rarely feel like a victim.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4849/244918-saints_row_2_pic_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-244918" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4849/244918-saints_row_2_pic_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-244918"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4849/244918-saints_row_2_pic_22.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4849/244918-saints_row_2_pic_22.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>You can also buy a number of gaudy cribs, just like this one.</figcaption></figure>While GTA IV went on to include the incredibly useful GPS navigation system first seen in Saints Row, Saints Row 2 still has a few unique tricks up its sleeve. The gang system allows you to roll around with a posse of disposable, computer-controlled gang-bangers. They have a tendency to get stuck in doorways, but they're pretty good at following your lead, and if you hop into a vehicle that doesn't have enough seats for your posse, they'll jack a nearby vehicle to keep up. There's also the cruise control option, which lets you maintain your speed without holding down on the gas, making drive-bys and highway mayhem easier to pull off.<br/><br/>You can play through the 20-plus hours of Saints Row 2 on your own, but the game also has a solid co-op feature that allows another player to jump into your version of Stilwater at any time. It doesn't change any of the narrative bits to reconcile the presence of two protagonists, and that can be a little awkward, but aside from being hindered by lag on a particularly fast-paced mission, I found co-op to be good fun.<br/><br/>There's no question that GTA IV is a better game than Saints Row 2, but in some ways, Saints Row 2 is more fun. Saints Row 2 doesn't look nearly as good, and there aren't any heavy moral choices or resonant melodrama, but the cars handle more easily, cops are less of a concern, enemies are easier to kill, and the activities are generally crazier and more over-the-top. If GTA IV got too serious for you, Saints Row 2 might just be what you're looking for.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20679/]]></api_detail_url><id>20679</id><name><![CDATA[Saints Row 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/saints-row-2/3030-20679/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-10-22 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72776/]]></api_detail_url><id>72776</id><name><![CDATA[Saints Row 2]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/saints-row-2-review/1900-70/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-71/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Fallout 3 has a few snags, but the quality of the overall adventure makes looking past its flaws worthwhile.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/618970-lady_k.png" data-ref-id="1300-618970" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/618970-lady_k.png" data-ref-id="1300-618970"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14220/618970-lady_k.png"/></a><figcaption>Perks let you further customize your character whenever you gain a level.</figcaption></figure>You know, let's just break it down up top. Fallout 3 takes the base level action of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, changes the setting from knights-and-wizards fantasy to mutants-and-raiders post-apocalyptic Washington DC, sprinkles on a handful of systems and references that are designed to remind you of the previous Fallout games, and sends you on your way. It's successful at giving you meaningful moral choices that, in a lot of cases, reshape the game pretty dramatically. But at the same time, by trying to be a wide-open game that accounts for multiple play styles, you really notice it when you bump up against the technical and storytelling limitations of the game and its narrative structure.</div><br/><div>The world of Fallout is the United States after a nuclear attack devastates the country and turns most of it into a flat, radioactive wasteland. To stay safe from the attack, many humans locked themselves in huge, underground vaults and lived there in relative safety. Others survive on the surface, and attempt to make lives for themselves in the rubble of what used to be the United States. Additionally, the game has a retro-futuristic tone to it that is one of its primary sources of humor.</div><br/><div>The game opens with your character being born, and there's a prologue in place that both serves as the character creation tools and a brief introduction to the game's world and controls. It's here that you set your stats, tag a few character skills as primary, and design the look of your character. You also get to know your father over the course of this sequence, which ends with him mysteriously escaping the vault, a move that has the Overseer of the vault hunting you down. So you escape the vault to avoid the Overseer's wrath, as well as to start tracking down your father. Along the way, you'll see how life on the surface works, follow your father's trail, and get wrapped up in a pile of side quests.</div><br/><div>Most of the quests in Fallout 3 can be completed in multiple ways, and the way you finish a quest can have substantial ramifications. Take, for example, the side quest called The Power of the Atom. This is one of the first side quests you might encounter in the town of Megaton. Megaton is so-named because there's a live nuclear bomb in the center of town. It leaks a bit of radiation and some local nutjobs worship it as some sort of great deity. The local law enforcement would be appreciative if you could quietly disarm the bomb. But a shadowy businessman in the local tavern offers you a hefty sum if you can rig the bomb to explode, instead. Since Megaton has other side quests and is also the place where you find your first lead on your father's whereabouts, blowing up the town can be a pretty dramatic act if you do it early on. It's a very cool moment.</div><br/><div>Unfortunately, most of the other quests don't quite have that level of impact. But that doesn't mean they aren't clever or interesting. You'll get sent on a lot of different missions, either purely as side endeavors or in order to satisfy a person and convince them to give you the next piece of the main quest line. And there are still others that you might be able to circumvent if your statistics are properly aligned. The speech skill seems especially useful for this, as talking your way out of violent situations is usually much faster and easier than blasting your way through the entire game. But some quests won't require you to have specific skills. It's more a function of whether you're going to play like a jerk, and choose the most negative thing on the dialogue tree, or try to be a bit more even-handed. The game does a good job of making you feel like your dialogue choices are meaningful, even if they're just different tones of voice that ultimately lead to the same conclusion.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/621290-vlcsnap_4616931.png" data-ref-id="1300-621290" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/621290-vlcsnap_4616931.png" data-ref-id="1300-621290"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14220/621290-vlcsnap_4616931.png"/></a><figcaption>Lockpicking is a very useful skill to have.</figcaption></figure>Avoiding combat was my method throughout my first playthrough of Fallout 3, and that's largely because I didn't find the combat to be very satisfying. Though the game takes place from a first-person perspective and you are often armed with a gun of some kind, this is not an action game, and it's certainly not a first-person shooter. If that's what you're after, you're going to find the combat flips between dull and frustrating. Since this still has the trappings of an RPG around the edges, things like your accuracy, damage, and chance to do critical hits are governed by statistics. Aiming for the head, however, is still your best bet.</div><br/><div>If the real time combat is getting you down, you can drop into a time-freeze combat mode called VATS. This lets you take aim at specific body parts on enemies by clicking on them, then you confirm the command and watch the combat play out. You're limited by action points, which regenerate over time, so you can't just rely on this for all of the game's fighting. But it regenerates quickly enough to be used pretty regularly, and when you're in close, you'll often just get a 95 percent chance to hit an enemy's head with all of your shots, which can decimate most regular foes quickly. Once I got the hang of this, my combat tactics turned from FPS-style strafing to just running up into the faces of my enemies, triggering VATS, and blowing their heads off with a combat shotgun or a Chinese assault rifle (which is way better than the regular assault rifle). This turned combat into more of a chore than any sort of exciting gameplay element, but the alternative of facing your enemies head-on, in real time, wasn't any better. Though you'll gain levels and become stronger as you play, the combat seems to stay roughly the same throughout the game, almost as if the enemies are leveling up along with you. The only difference-makers I got were perks that made me more effective at taking headshots in VATS mode, and things like that.</div><br/><div>Most of your enemy encounters take place in buildings, usually while you're trying to complete some mission objective. But there's also the wasteland of the game's overworld. You'll occasionally encounter mutant monsters, angry raiders, or wild dogs when you're running around topside, but it's called a wasteland for a reason. There's, like, nothing out there but scorched earth and rubble. So when you have to run from one torn-up settlement to a new one, you sort of just point yourself in the direction of the new place and hold forward until you get there. Maybe you'll want to stop and fight any random creatures that get in your way, but you usually run faster than they do, so unless it's a group of super mutants trying to gun you down, you can usually just keep running. Once you've been to a location, you can use your world map to warp around to the different locations you've visited, just like Oblivion.</div><br/><div>It's probably this sort of cowardice and constant running that resulted in me finishing the game at level 15, even though the level cap is 20. Getting from the game's intro to the end credits took me just over 25 hours, and I feel like I spent just as much, if not more time taking on side quests than I did following the main quest line. Along the way you'll meet a solid cast of characters that breathe life into the wasteland via some quality dialogue and interactions that feel meaningful. Even if you're going to turn around and gun them down, or just act like a horrible bastard the entire time, your dealings with these guys is what makes the game worthwhile. One could probably spend 50 hours or more exploring every nook and cranny of the Fallout 3 world, but I came away satisfied after finishing the game as a "good" character and putting significant time into a pair of more opportunistic or "evil" avatars. Depending on how much of a completionist you are, your own playtime can vary dramatically.</div><br/><div>Also--and I'll surely talk around the specifics of what actually happens at the end of the game--it must be said that the presentation on the game's ending is a bit unfortunate. You may have heard the talk from the developers about how the game has "hundreds" of endings. But the ending is comprised of brief static images and some bits of voiceover that detail what you did over the course of the adventure, and it sort of poorly stitches these moments together to form a stilted, jerky look at a few of the key things you did over the course of the game. Also, I feel like I outsmarted the game's final moments only to have it force me down a specific, undesirable path via one of the most angering lines of dialogue in recent memory. I'd really like to say more about this, because it still has me pretty riled up, but as it's effectively the end of the game, it would be uncouth to talk in specifics.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/617351-i_want_that_hat..png" data-ref-id="1300-617351" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/617351-i_want_that_hat..png" data-ref-id="1300-617351"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14220/617351-i_want_that_hat..png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14220/617351-i_want_that_hat..png"/></noscript></a><figcaption>This guy's the law in these parts, so watch yourself.</figcaption></figure>The game also has a lot of little issues, many of which are straight out of Oblivion, though there are some new ones, as well. NPC characters behave oddly, sometimes randomly switching between a too-slow walk and a hyper-speed run, usually because they need to be standing somewhere else to perform some kind of custom animation for you. It's as if the director shouted "places everyone! The player character is coming!" You'll still need to deal with encumbrance, and if you're holding more than the weight limit allows you'll move very slowly and be unable to fast travel. Maybe I just like to carry more than is necessary to always be prepared, but I felt like I was spending a ton of time managing my inventory over the course of the game. The game also has a third-person perspective that you can optionally use to play the game, but it's no good.<br/></div><br/><div>Also, the game autosaves every time you walk through a door or enter a new location. I ran into a spot where I had picked a lock, angering a nearby robot, who gave chase and alerted the entire town that I was a bad guy. I ran through a door, which saved the game in a state where I had very little health and had like eight people chasing after me, guns blazing. It led to a situation where the game would load up, I would attempt to run away, get killed, reload in the exact same state, die again, and so on for around 30 minutes. I finally managed to find a spot where I could duck and the game's questionable AI couldn't find me, and everything eventually got back to normal. But I didn't have a recent hard save at that point. If I had been caught with less health and placed in a spot where there was no way to escape, I probably would have been caught in a death loop with no escape and nothing to do but start over again. That... seems kind of bad. Take that as a warning and try to remember to manually save from time to time.</div><br/><div>Across the three platforms, the PC version of Fallout 3 is the best, provided you have hardware that can handle it. The PC version has better lighting, a bit more graphical detail, and just looks better, overall. It's a Games For Windows Live game, too, so if you're dead set on playing the game with an Xbox 360 controller, you can do that on the PC, as well. Additionally, it has achievements, just like the 360 version, though they're kept separately--this means you could technically double up, play the game to completion on both the 360 and the PC, and have double the points as a result.</div><br/><div>The 360 version is no slouch, though. It might not be quite as pretty as the PC version, but it still looks fine. The load times remain pretty reasonable. The PlayStation 3 version is below the 360 version, by comparison. The level of detail when you're in the wasteland or other areas where you can see for great distances isn't quite as good, the game seems to be a bit more aliased, and the frame rate isn't as smooth. Plus, the PS3 version of the game doesn't have any trophy support (yet), and the game actually freezes every time a status message, such as "so and so is online" or "DUDE HOW DID U GET FALLOUT 3 EARLY!!!!???" is on-screen. That's bad enough to make you want to log out of the PlayStation Network before booting up the PS3 version of the game.</div><br/><div>It's unfortunate that Fallout 3 is saddled with so many little- and medium-sized issues, because they get in the way of what's an otherwise fantastic experience. The world is well-realized and full of options. It'll be a struggle in spots, but I'm willing to guess that most people will be able to overlook a lot of the game's problems and still have a very good time exploring the irradiated wasteland formerly known as Washington DC.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20504/]]></api_detail_url><id>20504</id><name><![CDATA[Fallout 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/fallout-3/3030-20504/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-10-27 21:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72475/]]></api_detail_url><id>72475</id><name><![CDATA[Fallout 3]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/fallout-3-review/1900-71/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-72/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[This poor clone of today's music games is especially sad when you consider Konami's rich history with the genre.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/780266-rockrevpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-780266" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/780266-rockrevpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-780266"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/780266-rockrevpath.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Konami started this gangster isht...</figcaption></figure>You can trace the modern era of the rhythm game back to RedOctane and Harmonix. The hardware guys and the software guys, respectively, teamed up to create Guitar Hero, the game that brought us into this new era. Now that they're both split onto opposite sides of the Guitar Hero/Rock Band divide, it's easy to forget that they used to be bros. That makes it even easier to forget that they essentially created Guitar Hero by building a better, Western version of Guitar Freaks, Konami's guitar game that predates this current rush of plastic instrument madness by years--but only made it to home consoles in Japan. So it's a little sad to see Konami's current music game release, Rock Revolution. Sure, they're the original masters of the form, but this new release looks like it was cranked out by some new jacks who didn't know any better.</div><br/><div>If Rock Revolution was released in 2004 or 2005, it would have been revelatory. But by today's standards, it's way behind the curve. This is a three-player rhythm game that lets two players play guitar and bass while a third can play drums. The game is played in the now-typical rhythm game format, so you're rated on what sort of combo of properly hit notes you can string together as you play through the songs. Unlike the competition, Rock Revolution sticks to the flat, 2D presentation of the notes you need to hit, much like you'd find in the company's Dance Dance Revolution or other Bemani games. This looks kind of cheap, and also seems worse from a gameplay perspective, as you'll need to view the entire length of the screen to see what's coming up. A 3D "highway" where the notes come at you give you more information in less space.</div><br/><div>There are over 40 songs in Rock Revolution, and they're all covers. The game doesn't even acknowledge the original artists, instead just using a list of song titles on the back of the box and in-game. So if you're trying to figure out who originally performed "Sk8er Boi," the game doesn't make Avril Lavigne's name easy to find. Also, the quality of the covers in the game is almost universally awful, making the game sound like a deceptive Walmart compilation.</div><br/><div>The game attempts to carve out its own niche by offering different challenges in the game's career, such as one that places "poison" notes on the tracks. If you play too many of the bad notes, you'll automatically lose. Another speeds up the note track as your multiplier increases. Another mode has you play a portion of a song twice, then asks you to play that same portion without it telling you which notes you need to hit. Overall, I found all of these additions to be incredibly annoying. You can skip a bunch of them and still proceed through the career.</div><br/><div>There's also an online mode, which I've tried a couple of times now, but haven't run into anyone else playing it. The online modes are one-on-one versus, co-op, and band battle, which allows two groups to go at it. A studio mode lets you use the instruments to lay down your own tracks, though it doesn't seem like you can actually go back into the game and play these tracks, only listen to what you've recorded and add effects.</div><br/><div>The game doesn't have its own guitars, leaving you free to use a compatible product. On the 360, we tested it out with Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour guitars with no issues. The game will have its own drum controller coming out in November, but a menu option lets you switch between the Rock Revolution drums and a standard five-trigger setup that's compatible with Rock Band kits.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11300/428695-rock_revolution_6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-428695" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11300/428695-rock_revolution_6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-428695"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11300/428695-rock_revolution_6.jpg"/></a><figcaption>...and this the motherlovin' thanks they get?</figcaption></figure>The Rock Revolution drums feel overly complicated. They have six pads up top along with a kick pedal. The six pads feel like they were almost randomly slapped onto the rectangular box that houses the kit. While it might have more pads than the other kits, the positioning doesn't feel right. Some elevation between the different pads might have helped them make more sense when using them. Also, it's probably worth noting that bolts need to be hand-screwed into the frame to build these drums, which makes it harder to change heights for different players and gives you a small bag of parts that you'll have to store when it comes time to stash these in your closet.</div><br/><div>I kept looking for something in Rock Revolution that would redeem it and justify its existence. It's $10 cheaper than the average 360 and PlayStation 3 release. But $50 is still probably $30 too much for a game that comes off as a low-budget title. If you're playing loud enough, the noise from your plastic instruments will drown out the poor quality of many of the game's covers? No, that doesn't really play, either. Instead of trying to wrap my mind around this troubling cash grab, I'm going to move on and do my best to forget about Rock Revolution. I recommend you do the same.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20635/]]></api_detail_url><id>20635</id><name><![CDATA[Rock Revolution]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/rock-revolution/3030-20635/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-10-29 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-78146/]]></api_detail_url><id>78146</id><name><![CDATA[Rock Revolution]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>1</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/rock-revolution-review/1900-72/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-73/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[A suffocating level of difficulty limits the appeal of Rockstar's latest street racer.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9734/703929-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-703929" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9734/703929-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-703929"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9734/703929-10.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Day or night, you can run the streets of LA.</figcaption></figure>When the original Midnight Club first hit the PlayStation 2 way back in 2000, the whole street-racing phenomenon hadn't really hit the mainstream yet. Heck, <em>The Fast and the Furious</em> didn't even come out until the following summer. At this point though, street-racing video games has become a broad genre unto itself. Midnight Club: Los Angeles has the kind of open-world structure and bevy of customizable licensed cars that are part and parcel for the genre, but it differentiates itself by losing some of the neon-lit glamor in favor of a somewhat more grounded look at the City of Angels. It can also be a supremely difficult, frustrating game, due in part to that open-world structure, as well as some unrelenting racer AI.<br/><br/>Midnight Club: LA puts you in the role of an anonymous East Coast transplant whose only apparent interest is street racing. You'll meet plenty of colorful and often obnoxious characters as your reputation improves, but the game keeps it pretty light with the story stuff, so don't expect a crazy crime epic about dirty undercover cops and counterfeit krugerrands or anything like that. Instead, it's more of a street racing procedural with a focus on methodically working your way up in the scene.<br/><br/>Your character is a bit of a blank slate, but the real star here is the city of Los Angeles. Midnight Club doesn't attempt to map LA block-by-block a la <a data-ref-id="3030-11153" href="/true-crime-streets-of-la/3030-11153" slug="true-crime-streets-of-la">True Crime: Streets of LA</a>, but the general layout--which includes Santa Monica, Century City, Westwood, Hollywood Hills, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and the downtown area--is quite accurate, and the game features enough real landmarks to capture the feel of the city without being too romantic about it. And not just obvious stuff like the Hollywood sign or the Capitol Records building either, though those are in there too, but also Carney's Restaurant, Pink's Hot Dogs, the Standard Hotel, the Saddle Ranch, the Viper Room, Ripley's Believe it Or Not, and the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, just to name a few.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9734/703924-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-703924" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9734/703924-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-703924"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9734/703924-5.jpg"/></a><figcaption>I've totally bought shoes at that mall!</figcaption></figure>It's a really sharp-looking package, though one of the flashiest bits of Midnight Club: LA is essentially a loading screen. Any time you pause the game to look at the map or jump to a new location to start a race, the camera dramatically pulls up and away from your car, eventually showing an overview shot of the entire city, before zooming back down on your current location. It's a neat trick that lends the game a seamless feel while hiding any potential load times effectively. <br/><br/>The actual driving in Midnight Club is fast and loose, though it's also got some weight to it, something that's accentuated by the game's intense, borderline nauseating camera rattle and a default camera angle that really kicks out around corners. The game features some 43 licensed cars, as well as a few motorcycles. Most importantly, it's not all just late-model supercars, though there are a few of those, and everything features a driving profile that exaggerates that vehicle's strengths and weaknesses. There's plenty of car customization, both performance-based and aesthetic, though there's nothing here that hasn't been seen in other street racers.<br/><br/>Drafting is a big deal in Midnight Club: LA, and if you hang out in another racer's slipstream for a few seconds, you'll earn a quick nitrous-style boost. In probably the game's most ridiculous turn, you can pop your car up on two wheels, which is useful for avoiding scrapes and for keeping other racers from drafting behind you. Actually, more ridiculous than that are the unlockable special abilities, which include the ability to slow down time or use an electromagnetic pulse to disable competitors.<br/><br/>Like past Midnight Clubs, the game doesn't limit where you can drive during a race, though most races are littered with enough mandatory checkpoints that there are usually only a few feasible routes for any given race. You can't always see the next checkpoint from the last one, and the game never shows you more than two checkpoints at a time, requiring you to constantly check against the on-screen minimap to figure out where to turn next. <br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9734/703920-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-703920" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9734/703920-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-703920"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9734/703920-1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9734/703920-1.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The online modes can be an awful lot of fun.</figcaption></figure>While the boulevards of Midnight Club: LA can be very wide, they're also almost always choked with traffic, and splitting your attention between the map and the road all but guarantees lots of head-on collisions and wrong turns. This wouldn't be such a problem if the computer-controlled racers reflected these navigational issues. In most cases, if you make one significant mistake, your chances of catching back up are slim. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that many of the races run pretty long, and any lead you might be able to eke out will often disappear in the closing stretch.<br/><br/>Series races can be even worse, since they're often based on the first racer to win three races. With five racers in the mix, that means you can run 10 races, each of which can potentially run a good five or six minutes, before finally losing and having to do the whole thing over again. You still earn a little bit of money and rep for crossing the finish line even when you lose a race, but it's still a consistently goddamn infuriating experience.<br/><br/>Luckily, there's a nicely integrated 16-player online component that eliminates both the AI and traffic issues. The online cruise mode essentially turns the entire city into a giant lobby where players can queue up different events, kind of like Burnout Paradise, but more democratic. Here you can compete in standard races, a number of different free-for-all and team-based capture-the-flag variants, unordered races, and more.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the look and feel of Midnight Club: Los Angeles, and there's a good amount of content here, but the severe difficulty level makes it all much harder to appreciate. It's punishing, but if you're up for it, there are some sights worth seeing here.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20927/]]></api_detail_url><id>20927</id><name><![CDATA[Midnight Club: Los Angeles]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/midnight-club-los-angeles/3030-20927/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-10-31 11:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73372/]]></api_detail_url><id>73372</id><name><![CDATA[Midnight Club: Los Angeles]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/midnight-club-los-angeles-review/1900-73/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-74/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Gears of War 2 intelligently builds on the successes of the first game, resulting in an immensely appealing sequel that is better in almost every way.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4816/185553-tai.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-185553" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.63673469387755" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4816/185553-tai.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-185553"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4816/185553-tai.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Here's Tai, sporting this season's hottest in-game accessory, the flamethrower.</figcaption></figure>When I first got my hands on Gears of War 2, it didn't really feel like a dramatic leap above or beyond the original game. It lead to one of those satisfied feelings of "OK, good, they didn't screw anything up." Then I went back and popped in the original Gears of War for a quick comparison, and that's when I realized how much better Epic's new game was than the last one. Gears of War 2 offers refined gameplay, a better and more interesting campaign, expanded multiplayer, and significantly improved graphics. In short, it's just about everything you'd want out of a sequel.<br/></div><br/><div>The story of the original game was largely forgettable, but it did a fine job of establishing the world, the characters, and the conflict. Gears 2 assumes you're already up to speed on this stuff and throws you back into the role of Marcus Fenix. Now the leader of Delta Squad, Fenix and his ever-present hetero life-partner, Dom, are the men on the ground doing the heavy lifting in the humans' battle against the Locust. Those guys, in case you forgot, are the mysterious mixed-species group of underground-dwelling enemies from the last game.</div><br/><div>Gears 2 opens with a brief, optional training sequence to get you back up to speed on topics such as hiding behind things and shooting stuff. It seems that the Locust attacks have grown more bold in recent times, and they quickly attack the hospital being used as a base of operations for the human forces. This erupts into a full-scale operation that sends Fenix and his team below ground once again, to take the fight directly to the foes. It seems that the Locust have been sinking more and more cities, and the last human stronghold at Jacinto is in danger of falling, as well. That would probably be a bad thing.</div><br/><div>Immediately after the training sequence, Gears of War 2 gets down to business and lets you know that it's not messing around. The game works on a much larger scale than its predecessor, and an early vehicle sequence has you riding on a rig through waves of Locust troops and, as luck would have it, a handful of creatures that served as bosses in the first game. These bosses get absolutely ripped to shreds by the human forces. Big, imposing foes like the Corpser or the Brumak are practically treated as jokes right out of the gate, with more than one Brumak getting ripped apart by the turrets on your rig. This ends up feeling pretty awesome, as it lets you know in the game's early moments that you should expect to see bigger, more deadly stuff over the course of the game. And the rest of the game delivers on that unspoken promise.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/364/188024-g2p2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-188024" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/364/188024-g2p2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-188024"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/364/188024-g2p2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Make sure your cover doesn't crawl away from you.</figcaption></figure>As you move through the story, some of the things left open from the first game are filled in a bit, and you get to see a bit more of what's going on underground in Gears 2, but overall, I feel like the campaign asks more questions than it answers. For every glimpse of the Locust hierarchy you get, you seem to get two glimpses at things that are touched on, but not explicitly explained. While there's a lot to infer about things that occur during the campaign, some things feel too open. Either way, the game certainly leaves enough openings for a meaningful sequel, but not so many that you're left feeling unfulfilled at its conclusion. And it's probably a testament to the game's world that I'm left wanting to know more, instead of just slapping the "mindless shooter" tag on it and moving on.</div><br/><div>Gears of War 2 has new weapons and a new maneuver or two. Nothing that totally redefines the experience, as far as the mechanics go, but enough to keep things moving. The structure of the campaign is good about giving you variety. This isn't just moving from grub hole to grub hole, slinging grenades all the while. New enemies such as the ticker, which is sort of a skittering land mine that will run up to you while you're behind cover and explode, force you to be on your toes during fights. Enemies wielding flamethrowers or large shields also require you to vary your tactics a bit. In addition to that, there are a few vehicle sequences, each of which is really well done. They successfully break up the action at just the right moment and are pretty intense, too.</div><br/><div>The new weapons include a new class of heavy weapons that you can lug around at the expense of your speed, much like Halo 3's busted-off turrets. Most of these weapons are found in specific locations, though, so you won't really find yourself lugging around a mortar cannon from one fight to the next. The mortar's quite fun, letting you rain down with deadly missiles on your enemies, provided you can figure out the right distance to fire them. There's also a big chaingun-style weapon that's carried the same way. Smaller, but still plenty effective is the flamethrower, which quickly burns up your enemies. There's also a new burst-fire pistol that lays out a few rounds each time you pull the trigger. That said, I found myself sticking with the sniper rifle and the lancer (that's the main assault rifle that comes with a chainsaw bayonet) almost exclusively.</div><br/><div>The game's new moves include a chainsaw duel and the ability to take hostages as shields. When lancer blades clash, a button-mashing icon appears and a chainsaw duel starts. The person who slams B the hardest will win and cut the other person apart. Pressing A when near a downed enemy will pick him up and use his body as a shield. You're slowed down and forced to use a pistol when doing this, but you also become effectively invincible against most incoming fire. Once your "meatshield" takes enough damage, he'll blast apart into chunks or fall to the ground, leaving you exposed. You'll also find proper shields, which you can hide behind while on the move or plant in the ground and use as standard cover.</div><br/><div>Like the previous game, you can play through the campaign cooperatively, which is especially useful for the game's hardest difficulty setting, which only unlocks after beating the game once. There are four difficulties in all, with the second-highest, hardcore, feeling most like the first game's default level of difficulty. Below that, the enemies get easier and easier to deal with. The new casual difficulty feels like it's designed for people who don't play many games, and it has the side-benefit of letting you get revived by your AI teammates when you get shot and go down. It's a wider range of difficulty than most games have, which should ensure that there's a setting for just about anyone that picks up a controller. When playing cooperatively, each player can choose a different difficulty setting, which adjusts the damage done and the damage taken by the player.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/179444-flameboomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-179444" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/179444-flameboomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-179444"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/179444-flameboomer.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/179444-flameboomer.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>You're going to want to shoot this guy's fuel-filled backpack.</figcaption></figure>There's another new cooperative mode called Horde. This mode puts up to five players on one of the game's multiplayer maps. Then the map is repeatedly infested by AI-controlled enemies. They come in waves, and there are 50 waves in all. The waves move in cycles of 10, so wave 10 has the most and nastiest variety of enemies. Then it resets, so wave 11 goes back to fewer enemies, but one of the enemy's statistics--accuracy, health, or damage--is increased. Even on the game's lowest difficulty setting, this mode gets really tough. It's a great way for players who aren't comfortable with the thick, macho level of competition happening in the rest of the online modes to still enjoy the multiplayer maps. It's a great addition.</div><br/><div>Of course, you can also use those multiplayer maps for team-based multiplayer. The player limit has been raised to 10, making for a collection of five-on-five modes. The old favorites, such as Warzone, Execution, and Annex are still here and totally intact. The Assassination mode from the first game has been tweaked and renamed Guardian. In Guardian, as long as the team's leader is still alive, the other players can respawn. So a team must hit the opposing leader to stop the respawns, then finish off the remaining stragglers to win a round. Wingman breaks players up into teams of two, and the last team standing wins the round. It's a good inclusion that really emphasizes teamwork and sticking together. There's also a new capture-the-flag-style mode called Submission, which has you fighting over a stranded human and attempting to drag him off to the capture point. So there's a lot to do when you're playing multiplayer.</div><br/><div>Not only is there a lot to do online, but it's all quite good. Gears of War's multiplayer turned out to be vastly popular, and the things that made it stand out are here in the sequel, and often improved upon. The game makes use of a good, solid party system that makes it easy to group up with friends. Bots are also available if you don't feel like taking on the masses. And the map design is great. There are ten such maps already on the disc, and the game comes with a download code that lets you download five more maps. This "Flashback" pack gives you five of the maps from the first game, and they've all been given a graphical makeover to bring them up to par with the better graphics of the sequel.</div><br/><div>Yes, the graphics in Gears of War 2 are quite a bit better than the original. But you might not notice that unless you directly compare the two games. For me, nostalgia had already kicked in for the first game, and the first few times I played Gears 2, it looked as impressive as the first one did in its day. It's only upon direct comparison that I noticed how much more detail the world contained, from the ugly scar on Marcus' face to elaborate underground palaces. It's breathtaking, in spots. Also, it's quite colorful. This isn't "just another brown shooter." Even when you're underground, you'll see bright, colorful areas that really catch the eye, and lighting that really makes things stand out. You'll also see all that at a more stable frame rate than you did last time out. Things like cutscenes run more evenly, too.</div><br/><div>About the only negative thing I could say about the visuals is that you'll often see rough textures on-screen when a scene first loads, and then the real textures fade into view after they're loaded. It's minimal, but noticeable. Also, the load times are reasonable throughout. I tested the game out both on regular "old" Xbox 360s along with the currently available preview version of the new dashboard that will be released on November 19. The game loads fine off of the disc, but you'll see a bit of a speed increase on your loads if you fully install the game to a hard drive.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11677-Assault1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11677" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.57376490630324" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11677-Assault1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11677"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11677-Assault1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11677-Assault1.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Brumaks are tough, but you're tougher. Way tougher.</figcaption></figure>The game's audio maintains the same sort of dread-inducing music as the original game, with a few little hits and stabs thrown in to call out dramatic moments, signify the end of combat, and so on. The game's audio is another high-point, with lots of squishy, meaty noises that accompany when you blast someone apart with a shotgun, cut them up with a chainsaw, and so on. There's more battle chatter in Gears 2, and you'll hear friends and foes alike call out specific enemy locations, such as "behind the car!" It makes the battlefield feel a bit more alive.</div><br/><div>The characters from the first game return with their voices intact. The four-man crew from the first game are joined by some new blood who fit right in, but really, the original foursome are still the stars of the show. Marcus sounds even more grizzled, gravelly, and pissed off this time around. Dom, who is now pretty obsessed with trying to find his missing wife, alternates between anguish and anger. Baird continues to be a sarcastic jerk that you'd like to slap around a bit. And then there's Cole. The Cole Train's on-screen entrance in Gears of War 2 is probably one of my favorite moments in the entire game.</div><br/><div>The differences and enhancements in Gears of War 2 feel very calculated and intelligent. It's clear that no one set out to break things that worked before, and the most dramatic steps were taken in an effort to widen the game's appeal to players who might not be good enough to play it, otherwise. But it takes on this task without dumbing itself down and alienating the people who already liked the first game. Academically, it's interesting to see this balancing act in motion. But all you really need to know is that Gears of War 2 is a terrific, kick-ass shooter with enough stuff in it to keep you busy for a pretty long time.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20662/]]></api_detail_url><id>20662</id><name><![CDATA[Gears of War 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/gears-of-war-2/3030-20662/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-03 06:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72734/]]></api_detail_url><id>72734</id><name><![CDATA[Gears of War 2 (Limited Collector's Edition)]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/gears-of-war-2-review/1900-74/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-75/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Guitar Hero makes an interesting, if not always successful, transition to the full-band format.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/176369-guitar_hero_world_tour___rebel_yell.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176369" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/176369-guitar_hero_world_tour___rebel_yell.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176369"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/176369-guitar_hero_world_tour___rebel_yell.jpg"/></a><figcaption>An increasingly familiar sight.</figcaption></figure>Ever since <a data-ref-id="3010-648" href="/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648" slug="harmonix-music-systems-inc">Harmonix</a> and <a data-ref-id="3010-3468" href="/redoctane-inc/3010-3468" slug="redoctane-inc">RedOctane</a> broke up the original Guitar Hero band, it's become nigh impossible to talk about either <a data-ref-id="3025-289" href="/guitar-hero/3025-289" slug="guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a> or <a data-ref-id="3025-567" href="/rock-band/3025-567" slug="rock-band">Rock Band</a> without drawing comparisons betwixt, and Guitar Hero World Tour's introduction of drums and vocals to the mix only serves to make those comparisons all the more apt. So, let's state the general conclusion: Guitar Hero World Tour offers an experience that is so similar to what the Rock Band series has been serving up that the deciding factor for most is going to be the tracks that are on the disc. Guitar Hero World Tour feels a little coarse at times, and it's still finding its footing in the full-band format. But, it manages a few notable improvements, and it's still a pretty kick-ass Guitar Hero game.<br/><br/>You can buy Guitar Hero World Tour in a number of different packages, but to get everything out of the game, you'll need to pick up the Band Kit, which includes the game, a guitar controller, a drum controller, and a <span>USB microphone</span>. Or, at least, you'll need a set of comparable controllers, perhaps ones you picked up alongside a previous Guitar Hero or one of the Rock Band games, most of which are compatible between the two series. There are some unique touches to the new World Tour instruments, and in some ways they're better than the gear that's already out there, but they also come with a few caveats. <br/><br/>The new guitar has a larger, more realistically defined body shape, along with longer strum and whammy bars. It has a new star-power button right below the strum bar, basically where your palm rests. You can still activate star power by tilting the controller, and while it might be an issue of an old dog and new tricks, but I still found this method easier and less disruptive to the gameplay. Similarly, the new touch pad on the neck of the controller allows you to perform specifically marked solos without strumming, but it's an interesting feature that I didn't feel compelled to use, mostly because the buttons work just as well, and because of the time it takes to switch between the two.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/187984-2775a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-187984" data-size="medium" data-ratio="1.519512195122" data-width="410" style="width: 410px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:152.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/187984-2775a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-187984"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1840/187984-2775a.jpg"/></a><figcaption>This is probably the best thing about Guitar Hero World Tour.</figcaption></figure> The drums are a bit more distinct, primarily because they have five pads instead of the four found on the Rock Band drums, with two of them raised up and shaped to resemble cymbals. I came in skeptical about how this new setup would work, but in practice it's terrific. The three main pads are bigger than the Rock Band pads, making it easier to perform two-handed rolls on a single pad, and the raised cymbals make it feel a bit more like an actual drum kit. The additional pad makes the gameplay more interesting as well, and going back to Rock Band's four-pad gameplay feels a little empty. From a strictly mechanical perspective, this is the best drum experience offered in a music game right now.<br/><br/>The thing that really keeps me from recommending the Guitar Hero World Tour gear wholeheartedly is an issue of build quality. It's anecdotal evidence, but there are a number of people experiencing issues with pad sensitivity on the drums, myself included. I had issues with my guitar as well, which suffered from an ear-piercingly squeaky strum bar and a touch pad which, after an exceptionally heated solo, would randomly trigger even when it wasn't being touched. It's the kind of stuff that I'm confident will get worked out as the manufacturing process for these new designs get refined, but for now, if your living room is already crowded with one set of fake plastic drums and you've got more rainbow-buttoned guitars than you know what to do with, you can probably get along without adding to the clutter.<br/><br/>Guitar Hero World Tour makes a few tweaks to the mechanics of the different instruments as well, with uneven results. On the drums, you activate star power by hitting both of the cymbals at once, a system that I found much more dynamic and strategic than the blank fills used in Rock Band. Similarly, you activate star power on vocals by either clapping your hand against the top of the mic or pressing a button on the controller, but here it feels more intrusive and kind of awkward. When you play as a band, you share your star power meter, which makes it easier to quickly build up star power, but I found that guitar players have a distinct advantage in being able to trigger star power quickly, making it easier for those players to use star power they didn't earn.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/176370-guitar_hero_world_tour___rock_star_creator.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176370" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/176370-guitar_hero_world_tour___rock_star_creator.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176370"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/176370-guitar_hero_world_tour___rock_star_creator.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/176370-guitar_hero_world_tour___rock_star_creator.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>You can get real obsessive-compulsive with the character creator.</figcaption></figure>The introduction of new types of instruments begets some alterations to the Guitar Hero single-player format, though the progression remains familiar. The game is split up into individual instrument careers for guitar, bass, vocals, and drums, as well as a band career, which requires between two and four instruments to access. The careers are broken up into set lists of three to seven songs that you play consecutively, and the different difficulty levels have been incorporated so that you can now adjust your specific difficulty level between sets, but it's ultimately not that different from past Guitar Hero games. Consequently, it can feel a little too familiar at times, and it creates a sense of isolation between the different careers. <br/><br/>Most of the online modes in World Tour are similarly sufficient, if unambitious, allowing you to play against other players competitively or alongside them in an online band. The big left-field inclusion in Guitar Hero World Tour is the recording studio feature, which lets you create your own music, either by playing it live on the instruments, or sequencing it note-by-note. You can then upload to a central server for other players to download and play. I realize that user-generated content is all the rage right now, but the implementation here is too byzantine for most players, and the end results just don't sound that good. Even the catchiest, most interesting songs get buried by the game's cheap synthesized sounds, and everything ends up sounding like a clumsy MIDI file. <br/><br/>You can play World Tour as one of the cartoonishly archetypal characters from previous Guitar Hero games, or you can use World Tour's new character creator to make your own, oddly proportioned rock star. You get a lot of control over the details of your character's face, and there's enough variety in hair style and clothing options to style something unique. It would seem that one of the side effects of the new character creator is that all of the existing Guitar Hero characters have been remodeled, and they now look more like regular people wearing crazy costumes than they did in <a data-ref-id="3030-4031" href="/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/3030-4031" slug="guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock">Guitar Hero III</a>. <br/><br/>Throughout the career mode, you'll be joined on stage by the likes of <a data-ref-id="3005-1133" href="/billy-corgan/3005-1133" slug="billy-corgan">Billy Corgan</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-1132" href="/travis-barker/3005-1132" slug="travis-barker">Travis Barker</a>, <a data-ref-id="3040-54078" href="/ozzy-osbourne/3040-54078" slug="ozzy-osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>, <span>Sting</span>, <a data-ref-id="3005-1121" href="/jimi-hendrix/3005-1121" slug="jimi-hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <span>Zack Wylde</span>, <a data-ref-id="3040-2488" href="/ted-nugent/3040-2488" slug="ted-nugent">Ted "Theodore" Nugent</a>, and Paramore's <a data-ref-id="3005-982" href="/hayley-williams/3005-982" slug="hayley-williams">Hayley Williams</a>, and though they've been exaggerated to fit better with the overall art style of World Tour, they're generally pretty accurate. You'd think that all these real rock stars would make the experience feel all the more authentic, but the way the game uses them feels odd, particularly when they're pantomiming someone else's song. There's a real cognitive dissonance to watching Ozzy lip-syncing "La Bamba."<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4362/519725-ozzy_guitar_hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-519725" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.61678004535147" data-width="441" style="width: 441px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:61.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4362/519725-ozzy_guitar_hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-519725"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4362/519725-ozzy_guitar_hero.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4362/519725-ozzy_guitar_hero.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Yo no soy marinero, soy capitan!</figcaption></figure>Stuff like that is indicative of the kind of slapped-together feel of Guitar Hero World Tour's presentation. While the Rock Band games have put a priority on knowing touches that make you feel like you're in a working band, Guitar Hero is more concerned with the fantastical, larger-than-life myth of rock 'n roll, and it lets some of the details slide. The venues are colorful and over the top with all the nuance and reality of a superhero comic book, and the band animation can feel stilted and mechanical at times. As a somewhat relevant aside, the game is pretty thick with conspicuous in-game advertising that accentuates a certain mercenary undercurrent in the game.<br/><br/>When it comes to song selection, Guitar Hero World Tour stays true to its name, with a slant towards songs defined by their guitars. There's a lot of crossover between Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band 2, both thematically and in terms of specific tracks, but World Tour leans more towards heavy metal and classic rock, exemplified by the inclusion of three songs by Tool and two each by Jimi Hendrix and Ozzy Osbourne. But it's a big track list, and it really does feature some terrific variety, with its most dramatic examples including the Beastie Boys' “No Sleep Till Brookyn,” Michael Jackson's “Beat It,” Willie Nelson's “On the Road Again,” Blondie's “One Way or Another,” and Sublime's “Santeria.” <br/><br/>It's all performed by the original artists, and in some cases, it's based on a live recording. For Jimi Hendrix's “Purple Haze,” you get some winking lyrical changes and a woolly, improvised guitar solo, though “Kick Out the Jams” by MC5's Wayne Kramer gets lost in the live distortion. There's something more cohesive and critically pleasing about the song selections in the Rock Band games, but Guitar Hero World Tour feels a little more populist, and is still plenty of fun to play. As far as downloadable tracks go, the game launched with a few track packs and the full Metallica <em>Death Magnetic</em> album available for purchase. So far, Activision doesn't seem quite as committed with the downloadable content as Harmonix has been with Rock Band, though it's definitely been ramping it up.<br/><br/>There are some notable feature differences between Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band, and the attitudes are wildly different, but a lot of that feels a little academic in the grand scheme. Guitar Hero has some catching up to do when it comes to the full-band experience, but all the debatable points shouldn't keep you from rocking out.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20673/]]></api_detail_url><id>20673</id><name><![CDATA[Guitar Hero World Tour]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-02 20:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72478/]]></api_detail_url><id>72478</id><name><![CDATA[Guitar Hero World Tour]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/guitar-hero-world-tour-review/1900-75/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-76/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[This sequel trades mutant-infested islands for a war-torn African savanna with mostly positive results.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176549-farcry2_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176549" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176549-farcry2_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176549"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/176549-farcry2_06.jpg"/></a><figcaption>It's a jungle out there.</figcaption></figure>The first thing you need to know about Far Cry 2 is that it has nothing to do with the original Far Cry. That means no tropical islands, no <a data-ref-id="3005-2729" href="/jack-carver/3005-2729" slug="jack-carver">Jack Carver</a>, and especially no silly mutant outbreaks derailing the gameplay halfway through. In place of those things, you get an unnamed African nation torn apart by civil war, a hierarchy of ambitious local warlords, a group of profiteering mercenaries doing all the dirty work, and a sprawling mission-based open world. Some elements of the travel and combat can get frustrating from time to time, but digging into the available weapons arsenal and exploring a variety of combat tactics will yield a dynamic experience that happens to look downright beautiful.<br/><br/>You're on the ground to take out a guy called <a data-ref-id="3005-8298" href="/the-jackal/3005-8298" slug="the-jackal">the Jackal</a>, an American arms dealer who's supplying the weapons that are fueling the ongoing conflict. He'll drop in now and again, mostly when you're incapacitated, to dispense some wartime philosophy and manipulate events behind the scenes. There's more to the Jackal's motivations <span>than</span> acquisition of wealth, as you'll discover over the course of the game. His activities weave in and out of the larger struggle between the UFLL and the APR, the two warring factions that go through a rotating cast of leaders as their respective machinations come into play.<br/><br/>You can take on missions from both groups in any order, which gives the story a playing-both-sides-against-the-middle sort of feel. The outcome is generally the same regardless of which missions you do when, though. There are a few seemingly dramatic decisions required of you at key points in the story, but the effects of only one of those choices seemed truly meaningful to me after the fact. Still, the high points of the plot felt appropriately gritty and intense as they came.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/593141-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_04_51_52.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-593141" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/593141-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_04_51_52.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-593141"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/593141-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_04_51_52.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Every warlord wants a piece of the pie.</figcaption></figure>The game lets you pick a playable character from a group of international mercenaries, though this choice doesn't affect the gameplay, since your own character is never shown and never speaks. But it does remove that character from the merc pool, the remainder of which goes on to populate the game world as you play. These other guys and gals will sometimes act as buddies who will join you on some missions and save you when you take a dirt nap, and you'll find them hanging out in the local watering hole to offer some extra missions.<br/><br/>Your current best bud will also offer alternate, longer solutions to most story missions that result in higher reputation gain in exchange for higher risk. I took every one of these suggestions because they lengthened each mission considerably, taking me to more places and often giving me more interesting things to do than a simple "go here, kill this guy" directive.<br/><br/>The various buddies felt interchangeable to me due to their uniformly flat, dull voiceovers, but their collective presence enlivened the game world all the same. Poor voice acting plagues all the game's characters, actually; you really have to pay attention to keep all the faction bosses straight, since their unremarkable personalities tend to run together. It's not a deal breaker, but more emotive acting would have given the story a lot more dramatic heft.<br/><br/>Since this is an open-world game, you have to travel--mostly behind the wheel--between quest givers, objectives, weapons dealers, safe houses, and so on. Get ready to do a <em>lot</em> of driving, because these things are all spread far apart. And since you get attacked at every guard checkpoint you cross, and almost constantly harassed by roving bands of soldiers en route, get ready to do an awful lot of fighting outside your mission objectives, too. The core gunplay works fine, so it's not that combat itself is problematic, but having to constantly fight off attackers when you're already driving for five or ten minutes can get tedious.<br/><br/>You also need to learn how to manage combat properly to keep yourself alive. The designers give no quarter to lazy players; you always need to stay in cover and remain constantly vigilant, since you often get attacked from all sides and the underbrush sometimes hides your attackers. The game's health system also requires you to dress your wounds on the fly if you're below one out of five health bars, which entails a lengthy animation. If you get shot, you get knocked out of that animation, meaning you can't heal and will probably die, so again, cover is paramount.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/593167-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_04_55_59.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-593167" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/593167-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_04_55_59.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-593167"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/593167-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_04_55_59.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/593167-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_04_55_59.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The combat can be frustrating but also exhilarating.</figcaption></figure> Some other irritating moments can crop up, like when an attacking jeep runs you down and kills you outright before you can dodge it. These elements annoyed me at first but also made for some exhilarating combat situations when I learned how to handle them. Lastly, there's no auto-save feature, so you are strongly encouraged to save at every available opportunity to make sure you don't lose a lot of progress to a random battlefield mishap.<br/><br/>The game gets a lot more fun when you start to unlock more weapons. The vendors will give you simple missions to go out and blow up rival weapons convoys (which in itself is entertaining), and with each completed mission you'll be able to purchase better and more varied assault weapons, sniper rifles, pistols, explosive devices, flamethrowers, and so on. There are numerous accuracy, reliability, and ammo upgrades for each weapon, as well as character upgrades like a camouflage suit that limits enemies' ability to see you.<br/><br/>I found my enjoyment of the combat scaling to the number of weapons and upgrades I bought, as I tried different combinations of the aforementioned weapon types (you can only carry three weapons at once, one from each category). Story missions pay out liberally when you accept them--and you can also earn money by doing side missions like jacking into cell phone towers and intercepting hired-hit directives from a creepy computer-distorted voice--so I never lacked for the money necessary to increase my stockpile of better weapons and upgrades.<br/><br/>Given the amount of traveling around you have to do, the breathtaking graphics are very much to Far Cry 2's advantage. The game offers the lushest, most realistic jungles I've seen this side of <a data-ref-id="3030-11757" href="/crysis/3030-11757" slug="crysis">Crysis</a>, and the liberal use of high-contrast and HDR lighting makes the most of the game's day/night cycle. It seems a little silly to fawn over a video game sunrise when one should probably be outdoors enjoying a real one, but there are a few moments of jaw-dropping splendor here and there, when the giant landscapes and sunlight combine in just the right way. There's also a good range of environments to drive through, from barren deserts to dense forests, grassy plains, and so on. You can see the wind blowing ripples through the tall grass. Little touches like that make the game a joy to look at.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/593194-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_05_17_17.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-593194" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.524" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/593194-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_05_17_17.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-593194"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/593194-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_05_17_17.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/593194-farcry2fans.com_e107_my_gallery_08_08_23_05_17_17.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>No doubt this is a beautiful game.</figcaption></figure>In terms of presentation, the game is bent on making sure you see every gory detail from your character's perspective. This manifests in benign ways when you hand a manilla envelope to a warlord or climb up through a vehicle's roll cage to get into its turret. It also means you're forced to watch when your character field-dresses his or her wounds in the middle of a firefight when your health meter gets too low. These animations are quite well done but extremely painful to look at--unless you relish the sight of dislocated fingers being wrenched back into place, or bullets being dug out of a wound with a pair of pliers--so your enjoyment of these will come down to personal taste. If nothing else, it's worth pointing out that I was still seeing new variations even at the end of the game, like when my merc got a nail driven halfway in between his knuckles after an explosion. Ouch.<br/><br/>After you're done with the story mode, there's a decent class-based multiplayer mode here with deathmatch, capture the flag, and a hybrid VIP/control point mode. You can also advance your character's rank and available weapons over time by earning experience points, a la Call of Duty 4. Lastly, a fully featured map editor rounds out the multiplayer experience, so presumably there will be reasonably good new maps to play on ad infinitum, if the community takes to the editor. The multiplayer component certainly gets the job done, with all the fundamentals you'd expect out of a competent online shooter these days. But with more multiplayer-focused games like <a data-ref-id="3030-20777" href="/call-of-duty-world-at-war/3030-20777" slug="call-of-duty-world-at-war">COD: World at War</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-20662" href="/gears-of-war-2/3030-20662" slug="gears-of-war-2">Gears of War 2</a> so close on the horizon, I had a hard time wanting to stick with the online options here.<br/><br/>Besides, the dense, lengthy single-player experience is the real focus here and is worth the price of admission alone. You can easily spend 20 or more hours solely on the story, notwithstanding all the side missions available from weapons vendors, buddies, cell towers, and so on. There's a lot to do in Far Cry 2, and if you can get a good handle on the quirks of the almost constant combat scenarios you'll run into, the weapons variety, stunning visuals, and originality of the story and setting make for a well-rounded and satisfying shooter.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20665/]]></api_detail_url><id>20665</id><name><![CDATA[Far Cry 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/far-cry-2/3030-20665/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-03 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73319/]]></api_detail_url><id>73319</id><name><![CDATA[Far Cry 2]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Brad]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/far-cry-2-review/1900-76/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-77/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Sifting through user-created LittleBigPlanet levels and seeing the wonderful and weird things that people are making is a great way to spend an afternoon, a week, a month...]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1122/556895-little_big_planet1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-556895" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1122/556895-little_big_planet1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-556895"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1122/556895-little_big_planet1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>When Giant Skateboards Attack!</figcaption></figure>LittleBigPlanet is one part floaty platformer, two parts charm, and several thousand parts game-and-level creation tool. By allowing users to create and share the levels they've built, and by providing an intuitive front-end that allows players to quickly find the coolest levels, LittleBigPlanet excels whether you fancy yourself a bedroom game designer or if you just want to play the coolest things that others have built.<br/><br/><br/> So it almost goes without saying that you'll only get the most out of this game if your PlayStation 3 is online. That's not to say that the single-player components are terrible, but they're really just designed to get you thinking about the sorts of levels that you might like to make. You'll also unlock tons of parts and materials for building said levels as you burn through the game's official levels.<br/><br/> The actual gameplay in LittleBigPlanet is, for the most part, basic platforming. But the game turns the concept inside-out, and the core mechanics of the gameplay aren't as important as you might expect. The new core of the experience becomes digging around and finding the levels that people have been creating, or talking over level design ideas with friends. It's the shared experiences that come from LittleBigPlanet that make it so special. And these things can be so incredible that any issues with the way Sackboy jumps become mostly irrelevant.<br/><br/> But to discuss what, exactly, happens in LBP, yes, you can run and you can jump. You can also grab onto things, which is used most often for dragging things around the level or grabbing onto hanging sponges and using them to swing across fiery pits. The movement, especially in the air, is really floaty. You don't have a lot of air control and the game never feels very precise. You won't mistake Sackboy's movements for an old Super Mario game, for example. This sort of imprecision is fine once you get used to it, but it also places a bit of limit on the level design aspect of the game. Expecting precise jumps out of players seems to always result in heartbreak, sadness, and burned-up Sackboys.<br/><br/><br/> You can play with up to four players in a level at once. My experiences with the multiplayer were mostly negative, with a lot of slowdown and lag as the network tried to keep up with the players' movements. In a game with an already tenuous grasp on timing and precision, throwing in a bunch of random network congestion quickly makes the game unplayable.<br/><br/> OK, so the gameplay and control is a little weird for my tastes, and the levels that ship with the game aren't all that fun. Why, exactly, do I care so much about LittleBigPlanet? It's all in the level editor. Or, more specifically, what people are doing with that level editor. There's a wide variety of wild levels and concepts coming from players all around the world. There's a real Wild West feel to the created levels right now, and I'm not talking about cowboys. It feels like a frontier--like people are just going out and creating anything they can. Large numbers of levels are based on other properties, resulting in neat levels based on upcoming games like Mirror's Edge, or other favorites like Metal Gear Solid. Seeing other game worlds interpreted through the tools of LittleBigPlanet is pretty awesome, and usually pretty cute, too.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12482/792320-picture_2.png" data-ref-id="1300-792320" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.70903010033445" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12482/792320-picture_2.png" data-ref-id="1300-792320"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12482/792320-picture_2.png"/></a><figcaption>If you'd like, you could even create your own "death garden."</figcaption></figure>Of course, it's not all about boosting inspiration from some other property, and it seems like Sony or Media Molecule have started to crack down on some of the more egregious examples, like levels that re-create levels from Super Mario Bros. or a "PS3 vs. 360" level that was filled with big Xbox 360s. It's sort of a shame that the content has to be filtered at all, but I guess I understand why some of that stuff has to come down.<br/><br/> The level editor has already proven to be way more versatile than it initially seems. Players are creating the standard sort of obstacle courses that you'd expect, but they're also creating elaborate contraptions, like a working Pez dispenser or a functional calculator. Others are creating music levels that play crummy-but-endearing MIDI versions of songs while you stand on a button that drives a vehicle past all the notes. And a LittleBigGenius in Japan has managed to manipulate the levels in such a way as to create a horizontal-scrolling shooter--specifically, it's the first level of Gradius. Obviously, the control isn't as tight and fun as the original Gradius, but each one of these levels feel totally amazing, and searching through other users' levels becomes a wondrous act of discovery... though you'll certainly find some real stinkers in the mix, as well.<br/><br/> Of course, you can also create your own levels. The game is smart in that it forces a ton of tutorials on you before you are set loose into the editor for yourself. Building a basic running-and-jumping level is quite easy, and using things like motor bolts and the like to creating spinning objects or functional tires isn't much tougher. Even hooking up contraptions and devices to various switches so that you can control them is a lot easier than it initially sounds. The catch is that getting things just right will take a lot of time. I think most people will be able to pick up the basics very quickly, but it's going to take mountains of patience to create the masterpiece that's bouncing around in your head.<br/><br/> That's probably why it's so cool that you can easily seek out the game's best levels. There's a robust user-rating system in place, and a "cool levels" section seems to be pretty good about highlighting the best stuff. You can also add any level or person to your "hearted" list to easily find them in the future. Once you get to any single person's section, you can see the levels and people that they've hearted. So you could easily spend hours just digging deeper and deeper, bouncing from person to person, playing the levels they've created or liked. It gives the game a social networking feel.<br/><br/> And that's the "thing" about LittleBigPlanet. When you break it down to its component parts, there are a lot of little bits and pieces that aren't as cool as they probably could have been. I wish the platforming bits were tighter. I wish the servers weren't effectively broken for the first week or so of the game's release. I wish the online worked better. But when I'm just sort of digging around, uncovering the things that people have created and shared, all of that stuff becomes very easy to forget. When it's at its best, LittleBigPlanet offers excitement and the thrill of discovery in ways that no other console game ever has.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20602/]]></api_detail_url><id>20602</id><name><![CDATA[LittleBigPlanet]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/littlebigplanet/3030-20602/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-05 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73305/]]></api_detail_url><id>73305</id><name><![CDATA[LittleBigPlanet]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/littlebigplanet-review/1900-77/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-78/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Web of Shadows can get awfully repetitive, but this simple-yet-stylish action game still manages to make being Spider-Man feel awesome.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/340048-web_shadows_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-340048" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/340048-web_shadows_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-340048"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/340048-web_shadows_002.jpg"/></a><figcaption>As if New York weren't dirty enough!</figcaption></figure>It would seem that the elusive balance for a good Spider-Man game is to make web-swinging that's fun and intuitive while creating a combat system that plays to Spidey's limber, improvisational fighting style. Shaba's Spider-Man: Web of Shadows is probably the closest any game has come to realizing that ideal, though as much fun as it is to watch <span>Peter Parker</span>'s alter-ego run effortlessly up the sides of skyscrapers and use his web-spinners to get up-close and personal with his foes in some inventive ways, it gets old.<br/><br/>The plot of Web of Shadows, which revolves around <a data-ref-id="3005-932" href="/venom/3005-932" slug="venom">Venom</a>'s plan to overtake the city with his symbiotic spawn, is a dichotomous thing, serving to both tickle and enrage Spider-Man fans. The idea that Venom could just up and decide to start replicating himself, populating the island of Manhattan with teeming millions of other symbiotic beasties, is an infuriating one, and it's something that the game never even bothers to try and justify. Even worse, the game kicks off with Spider-Man getting back together with his original goop suit with a nonchalance that belies his troubled history with it. On the other hand, there's a really excellent <em>What If...?</em> quality to watching other Marvel heroes and villains get incorporated by Venom symbiotes. It makes for a few great moments, but in general, the story is poorly told and needlessly bewildering, and it features some breathtakingly bad dialogue. I actually died a little bit inside during an extended conversation about <a data-ref-id="3005-10" href="/wolverine/3005-10" slug="wolverine">Wolverine</a>'s MySpace page.<br/><br/>Beyond all that, Spider-Man should be a preternaturally nimble dude, something that Web of Shadows captures. You can use his web-spinners to swing around the city, an act that carries some momentum. It feels appropriately unpredictable, creating a controlled sense of danger. Part of what makes the swinging feel so good is the way Spidey will spin and flip and contort his body in some real trademark ways as he navigates the high-rises of Manhattan, brushing his hand along buildings when you get close, and kicking his legs when he gets near the ground. The zip-splat sound effects that go along with the swinging are a nice touch. Spidey can also crawl and run on walls, and the game features a ton of enemies that share this ability, allowing for some unique horizontal combat. <br/><br/>Web of Shadows is at its best when it blends the ground, mid-air, and wall combat together. For the most part the camera can keep up with this often dizzying action, though it can get twitchy in tight quarters. The targeting is a little loose, which can make it tough to pick a specific enemy out of a crowd, particularly when you're just throwing punches. You can whale on enemies with a standard attack, but that's not nearly as interesting as using Spidey's web-strike ability, which allows him to lash onto an enemy from a distance and zip towards them. From there you can choose to either leap off the enemy and target another, or perform an intricately choreographed series of attacks.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/340049-web_shadows_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-340049" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/340049-web_shadows_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-340049"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/340049-web_shadows_003.jpg"/></a><figcaption>This is a lot less dangerous than it looks.</figcaption></figure>The real justification for the whole red-suit/black-suit duality of Spider-Man is a mechanical one. You can switch between the two suits at any time, and each gives you slightly different abilities. For example, the black suit gives Spider-Man super-strength, allowing him to pick up and toss cars at enemies, as well as the ability to lash out at enemies with gooey symbiotic tendrils, while the red suit allows Spider-Man to regenerate his health more quickly and perform some special web-based attacks. Defeating enemies and completing missions earns you experience points which you can invest in new abilities for the individual suits, though depending on how you play the game, it's not hard to have enough points to max out both.<br/><br/>There's also a flimsy morality system that, depending on your actions in specific situations and which suit you use, will determine whether you'll be able to call in assistance from either heroic or villainous support characters. As chic as moral choices in games are, it's just window-dressing here, since you'll always be able to call in someone regardless of your choices, and I found that Spider-Man is such a bad-ass that I very rarely needed the help. Ultimately, the often subtle differences between the two suits aren't enough to differentiate them, and the whole system is superfluous.<br/><br/>Web of Shadows opens strong, but it seems like it runs out of interesting and varied ways to put them to use well before you get to the end, and it turns into a bit of a grind. After the novelty of being able to go from swinging through the air to running up the side of a building to zipping up on an enemy and giving them the old biff-pow wears off, you're left with a lot of missions that seem to always come down to traveling to a location and beating up some dudes. Still, Spider-Man looks great in action, and the game is better about giving a sense of that oft-discusses conditional “great power” than any Spider-Man game before it.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20762/]]></api_detail_url><id>20762</id><name><![CDATA[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/spider-man-web-of-shadows/3030-20762/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-05 20:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72566/]]></api_detail_url><id>72566</id><name><![CDATA[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/spider-man-web-of-shadows-review/1900-78/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-79/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Quantum of Solace is middle-of-the-road entertainment that has just enough mild highs to balance out against its mild lows.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/727781-jb_sp_s2008_10_0719_35_39_11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-727781" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/727781-jb_sp_s2008_10_0719_35_39_11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-727781"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/727781-jb_sp_s2008_10_0719_35_39_11.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Hey everyone, please stop shooting me while I slowly hit this guy in the face. Cool?</figcaption></figure>Activision's first James Bond game, Quantum of Solace, is almost as deceptive as the spy who stars in it. While it might be named after the current Bond film, the majority of the game's levels are one big flashback to <em>Casino Royale</em>, the previous one. While the plots of the two films will be connected, this is a bit much, and the structure of the game is pretty ridiculous. Once you get past the misleading name, Quantum of Solace has its moments, but it also has its flaws.<br/></div><br/><div>The game opens where the film, <em>Quantum of Solace</em>, opens, essentially picking up right where Casino Royale left off. After a few chapters devoted to that, you run into a character who asks why you're after the same bad guy she is. You tell her in the form of the rest of the game--a Cliff Notes version of <em>Casino Royale</em>'s plot that skips all the card-playing and sticks to the action sequences. Once that's done, you play through one of the action sequences from the upcoming film and call it a night.</div><br/><div>The game is a first-person shooter with a <a data-ref-id="3015-55" href="/cover-system/3015-55" slug="cover-system">cover system</a>. When you take cover, the game pulls out to third-person shot, which simultaneously gives you a bit more awareness of what's going on around you and lets you look at the game's <a data-ref-id="3040-90200" href="/daniel-craig/3040-90200" slug="daniel-craig">Daniel Craig</a> player model. It's a pretty good model. The game looks and feels like a stripped-down Call of Duty game, enhanced in some spots and reduced in others. On one hand, the cover system is very handy and changes the pacing quite a bit. On the other, Bond is almost too accurate with his weapons. Blindfiring head shots is most certainly possible at ranges that, well, only an international superspy or carnival trick-shot artist would be able to pull off. Takedowns are another moment where you'll see James Bond on-screen. They're also another "like <a data-ref-id="3030-2133" href="/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133" slug="call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare">Call of Duty 4</a>, but..." moment. You initiate a takedown by clicking in the right stick when you're up close, like you were trying to stab someone in COD4. But instead of an instant jackmove, this initiates a one-button <a data-ref-id="3015-6" href="/quick-time-event/3015-6" slug="quick-time-event">quick time event</a> that results in a slow-motion animation of you knocking out your foe. It takes too long and the animations get old fast.</div><br/><div>The game occasionally breaks out of its shooter trappings into sequences where you'll have to shimmy along the outsides of buildings, or keep your balance as you run along a narrow beam. You'll also find a few spots where you can optionally play for stealth and avoid detection by shooting out or dodging security cameras. But for the most part, this game is all about lining up headshots while behind cover and taking them. As long as you're patient about sticking behind cover, you'll be fine. Even though the game is better about breaking you out of the shooting than some of the previous Bond games have been, overall, the single-player portion of Quantum of Solace is just kind of boring. Nothing terribly wrong with it, but you've probably played plenty of more entertaining shooters over the years.</div><br/><div>The multiplayer portion of Quantum of Solace feels superfluous and unnecessary for the same reason. There are plenty of better shooters out there. The guns don't feel impactful, the characters move around in a very skittish way, and every player model seems to just shout "I'm empty" again and again and again. "Empty" sums up the multiplayer pretty well. You'll find a smattering of standard modes, as well as a few Bond-specific styles like Golden Gun, where players struggle to control a golden pistol that fires explosive rounds. As you play, you'll earn credits that can be used to purchase weapons and upgrades that you can use in future multiplayer matches. That's probably the neatest idea in the entire game, even if it's mostly a retooled take on the COD4 weapons and perks customization systems.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/176411-quantum_of_solace___explosion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176411" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625539257981" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/176411-quantum_of_solace___explosion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176411"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/176411-quantum_of_solace___explosion.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Shooting explosive things is handy, but headshots are just about as fast.</figcaption></figure>The graphics are where Quantum of Solace gets a bit dicey. The game's lighting is pretty bad, with most things having a sort of full-bright look to them that makes the environments look garish and, at times, washed-out. The animation for moving enemies is stiff, and things like explosions and other effects don't really stand out. The music is, as you'd expect, full of songs that occasionally recall the famous James Bond theme. Most of the relevant actors and actresses from the films show up to put on a performance here, and they do a fine, if unremarkable job.</div><br/><div>Even when you factor in the way Daniel Craig's James Bond has been a rougher, more action-oriented take on the character, Bond is a spy. He should be out doing ill, spy-related acts of espionage as he spies it up with other spies. Instead, he's cast as an almost-faceless gunman yet again. If you were hoping that Activision's take on the license would be any more faithful than most of the games that EA put out while it held the license, you'll probably be disappointed. But on its own, Quantum of Solace is a passable shooter in a world that's filled with much, much better ones.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20726/]]></api_detail_url><id>20726</id><name><![CDATA[Quantum of Solace]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/quantum-of-solace/3030-20726/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-07 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73300/]]></api_detail_url><id>73300</id><name><![CDATA[Quantum of Solace ]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/quantum-of-solace-review/1900-79/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-80/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Resistance 2 ditches the storytelling in favor of an excellent multiplayer experience.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p>Oh, Resistance 2! You are so confused about what you want out of me. Do you want me to play through your horrible single-player campaign, with its erratic and nonsensical storytelling?

I was following you!</figcaption></figure>The story in Resistance 2 picks up immediately after the events of its predecessor, Resistance: Fall of Man. You again jump into the shoes of American solider Nathan Hale. Nathan, and the rest of the world, are fighting against what appear to be alien invaders, dubbed the Chimera, though the aliens are actually humans who have been transformed through some kind of horrible infection. Nathan himself was infected in the original Resistance, but instead of going over to the dark side his condition gave him the edge to become the savior of the day. A hero's work is never done and Resistance 2 begins with Nathan being abducted by some special military organization. It turns out that this group is actually responsible for experimenting on humans with the alien virus in an effort to create super soldiers--but they're still the good guys...I think. En route to their special facility your helicopter crashes--the first of numerous fateful downings--and you'll fight a bit before quickly being introduced to some kind of Chimeran smart bug. Without so much as a sinister expository preamble, this malicious alien-man-thing dons his MacGuffin hat and escapes to wreak havoc on the world. You are then sedated and the prologue ends. Welcome to Resistance 2! Fast-forward two years later and you're now buddy-buddy with these special forces fellows. Oh, did I mention you've had some kind of experimental operation and your crazy underwater base is under attack? GO!<br/><br/>So that's the setup. You're still infected but now you need regular doses of antigen or things will apparently go very badly. Also, some of your comrades don't much appreciate the busy and heroic lifestyle that will inherently keep you away from said meds. That's about all you need to know about the story. You're obviously trying to save the world again, and this time  around it's not the lonely, silent trek it was in the first installment. You'll be treated to a stable of recurring supporting characters, but they are never clearly defined and by the time the game hits its conclusion, you really won't care. Neither will Nathan apparently, as he seems totally indifferent to the fields of death being sowed around him. That's not to say these brave souls are worthless, as the game is actually at its best when it throws you into the midst of larger, epic battles with your allies. This also works to give you the impression that there is a lot more going on behind the scenes, but none of that information is ever presented to you in a reasonable or coherent manner.<br/><br/>While the game is supposed to be taking place in an alternate version of the '50s, you'll never really get that vibe aside from the old cars and some antique radios. The weapons you'll be using will mostly be alien, or at least modified beyond anything recognizable for the time period, and any allies you have with you will do little to keep you in the spirit of the era. The only thing that maintains some semblance of time and place is a distraught radio announcer that you'll occasionally be able to overhear as you checkpoint your way across America. The poor guy is actually one of the better story elements in the game, and it's probably worth your time to sit and listen to his morbid antics.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/350321-resistance_2_leviathan__1_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-350321" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/350321-resistance_2_leviathan__1_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-350321"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4759/350321-resistance_2_leviathan__1_.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Well, this is happening now...</figcaption></figure>Those are my biggest gripes with the game, though there were a few more minor annoyances. I really enjoyed much of the actual combat and gameplay, aside from a few enemy behaviors with which I took issue. You'll trade fire with your standard Chimeran grunts, but you'll also encounter some special units, like the invisible Chameleons. Now, in addition to being able to cloak themselves, they'll also charge you, and they'll kill you in one hit. Apparently they make some noise when they are around, but as far as I could tell it all just sounded like pigeons cooing. To counter this, the game automatically saves checkpoints pretty frequently, so you'll never be too far away from your last sudden and surprising place of death. This leads to a lot of try-and-die gameplay, and you'll find things are not so tough when you have some fair warning. There are also some new zombie-like Chimera which will swarm at you as you try to mow them down. These are definitely of the “fast zombie” variety and I found myself backed into a corner more than once, screaming “Oh God, Oh God, Oh...I'm dead.” These baddies are hatched from cocoons and you'll mostly encounter them in the overrun towns you'll be traipsing through. While the “body snatchers” idea definitely adds to the creepier direction this game has adopted, it doesn't seem to make much sense as these young turks don't need the special cooling systems that the rest of the Chimera use to prevent them from overheating. The first game went so far as to have entire conversion centers for the processing of humans into Chimera. It's minor, but it bugged me.<br/><br/>You'll be treated to some new weapons but you'll also see some slightly modified versions from the original Resistance armament. The Auger, which originally only allowed you to blindly shoot through walls, now lets you keep track of your target as he hides behind cover, which is very, very handy. Each weapon, again, has two modes of fire and this time around I found myself using them often. The magnum, for example, not only packs quite a punch with its primary fire but, using the alternate fire, you can subsequently detonate any spent rounds. This is a quick way to improvise an explosive surprise for the oncoming hordes of Chimera. The only time I found myself getting frustrated with the weapons is when one of my less-than-effective teammates was wielding one of the rarer heavy weapons, with seemingly unlimited ammunition. In my hands that weapon could turn the entire tide of the war! Sadly, the opportunity to sacrifice that young man for the good of mankind never presented itself. <br/><br/>The locations have also been well expanded beyond the seemingly endless grey, industrial maps of the original. You'll be greeted by some really spectacular set pieces as you as span a good chunk of North America in your quest to do something...or other. Not all of the locales are great, but when they work, they work with flourish, and you won't be disappointed in the eye candy.<br/><br/>Once you've finished the campaign you can go back and select any level to replay. This is helpful if you want to collect any missing pieces of intel you may have missed your first time through. These sparse collectibles are really your only window into the overarching fiction.  As someone who really appreciates some narrative context surrounding my mass murder, I found myself desperate to latch onto anything that might give me some more insight. While the intel you find won't do much to make the entire world make sense, it is a must for anyone hoping to extract even the slightest bit of coherence from the plot.<br/><br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/350922-resistance_2_multiplayer_14_06_08_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-350922" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/350922-resistance_2_multiplayer_14_06_08_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-350922"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4759/350922-resistance_2_multiplayer_14_06_08_07.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4759/350922-resistance_2_multiplayer_14_06_08_07.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Fighting other humans is where this game shines.</figcaption></figure>Really, though, all this single-player nonsense is just an introduction and setup for the much more engaging multiplayer. It's in the cooperative and competitive multiplayer that Resistance 2 really begins to deliver on being one of the best shooters for the PlayStation 3. While the head scratching single-player campaign will take you all of 8-10 hours, the multiplayer modes are where players are going to sink the majority of their time. Both modes offer a leveling system that allows you to gain experience and unlock new items and abilities. It's easy to get engrossed in the constant need to reach the next level with any given class, and that's further aided by the ease with which you can actually get into games. Both modes include a button labeled “play” which instantly takes you into the action and on the road to gaining experience. While you still have the option to manually setup or pick a map, being able to get into a game in one button press really takes the anxiety out of having to find a group, especially for the co-op.<br/><br/><br/>Calling the co-op a campaign is actually a bit of a misnomer. It really has nothing to do with the single-player campaign, other than taking place in the same universe and making liberal use of that special forces team you just met. Upon starting a map, you, and up to seven other players, will pick a class from three different archetypes: soldier, special ops, and medic. The most outstanding element is how much all these classes need to rely on each other, probably more than in any other class-based shooter I've played before. The medic will obviously heal your team while the special ops member is your only source of ammunition. The soldier class gets the heavy weapon and he'll be at the vanguard of your attacks. Luckily, the secondary fire on his weapon will throw up a shield and protect him from incoming fire, but it's still in everyone's best interest to constantly feed him health and ammunition. It demands a balanced and diverse team, and grouping with a party that understands these particular roles is a rewarding and unique experience. <br/><br/>Speaking of experience, you'll be racking it up almost constantly while you blast your way through each map. New levels will unlock new weapons and abilities, making you all the more eager to hit that play button again and again. Your team will also have the opportunity unlock a certain amount of something called “grey tech” per map, depending on how far you can make it without everyone dying. This grey tech can then be spent on even more upgrades for each class, and unlike earned experience, the amount of grey tech you have acquired isn't locked to the particular class with which you may have earned it.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22263/779986-orick_chameleon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-779986" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.54981084489281" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22263/779986-orick_chameleon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-779986"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22263/779986-orick_chameleon.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22263/779986-orick_chameleon.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>These are some really nice places for killing.</figcaption></figure>On the competitive side of the multiplayer you'll find Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Core Control (essentially capture the flag) and Skirmish. Skirmish is probably the most exceptional, and for my money, the most entertaining of the bunch. This mode allows a total of 60 players--yeah, 60--to compete in a variety of objectives. The players are broken up into two teams, each of which is further broken up into smaller squads and then assigned their own unique objectives. It's a really fun mode, which will have your squad racing around the map to different flash points as new objectives appear. It's also a mode which makes good use of the extremely high player counts, whereas some of the others felt a little too chaotic for my aging reflexes. Luckily, when I got bored or embarrassed in the competitive arenas I would drag my sorry ass back to the excellent eight player co-op, which is where I spent the majority of my time.<br/><br/>So there you have it. Resistance 2 has a rubbish single-player campaign, which left me angry and confused. The lack of coherent storytelling is my biggest issue, but there's really nothing wrong with the overall gameplay. I am still of the opinion that the rest of the package makes it one of the best multiplayer shooters currently out for the PlayStation 3. Though my experience with the co-op definitely varied depending on the group I was with, it never ceased being entertaining. On top of that, the leveling seems to come slowly, but just quickly enough to keep you coming back for more. This game does not stand out for its single-player content, but those interested in sinking hours and hours into a unique and rewarding multiplayer shooter experience will find Resistance 2 well worth their money.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20699/]]></api_detail_url><id>20699</id><name><![CDATA[Resistance 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/resistance-2/3030-20699/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-10 14:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73294/]]></api_detail_url><id>73294</id><name><![CDATA[Resistance 2]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Vinny]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/resistance-2-review/1900-80/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-81/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Call of Duty: World at War is a great first-person shooter, but it's still stuck in the shadow of an even greater one.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1757/777823-nazizombies12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-777823" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56105263157895" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1757/777823-nazizombies12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-777823"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1757/777823-nazizombies12.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Never underestimate the power and beauty of fire.</figcaption></figure>After a wildly successful tour of duty in the modern era, Activision's Call of Duty series heads back to the 1940s with World at War, a WWII-focused shooter that attempts to do many of the same things that the previous game did, but in a different time period. It's interesting to watch those different facets of a modern game as they're molded to fit into an earlier conflict, and it works better than you'd probably think. At times, though, it still feels like a knockoff of a better game.</div><br/><div>The game's campaign splits time between two different fronts. For half the game, you'll play as an American Marine taking on Japanese forces as you push from their forward island bases all the way back to Okinawa. The other half puts you in Russian boots as you strike back against the Germans, pushing them out of the motherland and sieging Berlin. You know, just like the real thing! Like the previous game, the campaign jumps back and forth between the two perspectives. So you'll play a level or two as one guy, swap to the other for a bit, then swap back. This keeps up over the course of the game's 13 missions.</div><br/><div>The campaign provides a good amount of first-person shooter variety, but it excels when the levels are wide open and all hell is breaking loose around you. There are more than a few moments where you're charging against an entrenched enemy, and the game does a good job of making these moments feel appropriately chaotic. You'll also see the requisite vehicle sequence and some up-close indoor battles. Overall, there really aren't any surprises coming out of the single-player--it's a quality single-player campaign from beginning to end.</div><br/><div>You can also play the campaign mode cooperatively with up to three other players joining you via system link or over the Internet. Most of the cues for this aspect of World at War seem to come from Halo 3's co-op. You can enable competitive scoring, which makes you want to kill everyone before your partners can. You can also find and unlock "death cards" in each level. Each one you collect lets you enable a little modification in future co-op matches. These are, essentially, the skulls from Halo 3. Some of these cards let you fire explosive pistol rounds while you're downed, or make it so your enemies only die when you shoot them in the head. This gives the co-op some pretty decent options. Still, it's a little jarring that the game dumps you back to the lobby after every mission, instead of letting you just keep on playing with no breaks.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1987/801125-codwaw_2008_11_09_22_43_37_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-801125" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1987/801125-codwaw_2008_11_09_22_43_37_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-801125"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1987/801125-codwaw_2008_11_09_22_43_37_07.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Black-and-white footage abounds!</figcaption></figure>The competitive multiplayer probably has the best chance of roping you in for hours and hours. This portion of the game feels like a really well-made mod for Call of Duty 4 that replaces all of the modern stuff with World War II stuff. Most of the things from COD4 are represented in some way. Instead of calling in radar when you get a three-kill streak, you can call in a recon plane... which has the exact same effect of showing dots on your map that represent enemy locations. Since helicopters and World War II don't mix, they've been replaced by dogs. Calling in the dogs on your foes is pretty funny and useful in multiple ways. While wily players can stick the dogs with a knife or gun them down before getting ripped apart, you can still follow your dogs to find the enemy. It's a clever addition.</div><br/><div>The game has the same sort of player customization and experience point system as last year's release. So as you play, you'll gain levels, which in turn unlocks additional items and configuration options. You'll be able to set perks on your player--these are special skills and enhancements like the ability to reload faster, or a gas mask perk that makes your soldier able to withstand the effects of gas grenades more easily. There's also a new vehicle perk that lets you give your soldier enhancements like faster turret turning speeds.</div><br/><div>Some of the multiplayer maps contain tanks, which let one player drive and another work a machine gun turret atop the tank. The tanks are probably going to be a dividing inclusion. While I like rolling around and gunning down enemy soldiers from the relative safety of a tank, I really don't like that the vehicle levels have to be open enough to accommodate the tanks. While only four of the game's 13 multiplayer maps contain vehicles, these maps seem like they come up in the rotation a bit more often than the others. If you're setting up private matches, that probably won't matter to you at all. They just feel too large, like you're having to hunt around for the action.</div><br/><div>Fire seems to be a big visual theme in Call of Duty: World at War. Large portions of the campaign are devoted to running around with a flamethrower and burning as many Japanese soldiers as possible. You'll run through burning buildings. And if you play long enough, you'll be able to unlock that flamethrower for use in multiplayer. The fire effects, thankfully, are good enough to warrant their featured position. The flamethrower snakes around as you wave it and burns up most nearby grass and trees as you go. Creeping through dark, but still-burning buildings shows off the game's terrific lighting, as the soft glow of the flames reflects and flickers onto the nearby walls. All of the lighting, really, is well done. The game has a really dingy, dark look to it that helps make everything you're doing feel at least a little dreadful.</div><br/><div>You'll get a bit of Hollywood-style voice acting via Keifer Sutherland and Gary Oldman. Both play characters that guide you through most of the campaign mode, making sure you're pointed in the right direction and giving the general sort of wartime orders you'd expect to hear out of your sergeant. They also serve as announcers in the multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode feels a lot more chatty this time around, as most of the soldiers will curse and/or shout about something whenever they get a kill.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1987/801102-codwaw_2008_11_09_21_30_41_23.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-801102" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1987/801102-codwaw_2008_11_09_21_30_41_23.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-801102"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1987/801102-codwaw_2008_11_09_21_30_41_23.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1987/801102-codwaw_2008_11_09_21_30_41_23.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The larger levels are cool in single-player, not-so-cool in multiplayer.</figcaption></figure>The rest of the game's audio is fine, too. The weapons sound period-accurate and the battlefields always sound pretty intense. There's a lot of modern-sounding guitar rock on the soundtrack, which kind of makes the whole game feel like some kind of poorly-edited YouTube video. It's like what I imagine would happen if you asked a 15-year-old to make World War II footage interesting or something. It serves its purpose by picking up alongside the action and fading down for the quiet, creeping times. But it still feels out of place. The developers changed the clinky, weird noise that grenades make when they land. While this might sound more realistic, it also has the maddening effect of forcing me to retrain myself to hear the new grenade noise after killing someone online. So the martyrdom perk, which has soldiers drop a live grenade every time they die, is, at least until I can get used to the new sound, way more effective. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, mind you. In fact, that chintzy grenade effect from the previous game always seemed a little out of place. </div><br/><div>Of course, these are all pretty minor points in the grand scheme of things. Call of Duty: World at War is a perfectly competent game with exciting multiplayer options and a campaign that's worth playing. But in most of the ways that actually count, last year's game was better.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20777/]]></api_detail_url><id>20777</id><name><![CDATA[Call of Duty: World at War]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-world-at-war/3030-20777/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-11 12:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72604/]]></api_detail_url><id>72604</id><name><![CDATA[Call of Duty: World at War]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/call-of-duty-world-at-war-review/1900-81/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-82/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Sony fleshes out its chaotic off-road racing series with this rough-and-tumble sequel.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/255146-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255146" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/255146-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255146"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5338/255146-1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Trucks!</figcaption></figure>While the original MotorStorm was most certainly a victim of heightened expectations, its distinct lack of visual variety and an underwhelming single-player structure were still very real problems. MotorStorm: Pacific Rift makes amends for these shortcomings, and it's successful in some significant ways, making for a much more thrilling experience.<br/><br/>Maintaining the same Burning Man/Mad Max/Burning Max posture as its predecessor, Pacific Rift moves the action out of the desert and onto a fictional uninhabited island in the Pacific, which serves as a microcosm for a number of different, lushly detailed natural environments. You'll rip through the underbrush in dense jungles, splash across white-sand beaches, skitter around lava floes, navigate the rusted-over remains of an abandoned WWII military base, and more. One of Pacific Rift's biggest strengths is how wide-open and organic the tracks feel. Rather than feeling like you're going through race tracks that have been skinned to look like rare exotic locales, you get the sense that some people showed up and decided that the shale-covered cliffs surrounding this active volcano would be a great place to stage a race.<br/><br/>This willful inconsistency does wonders for the game's authenticity, and lends the game a certain danger-of-the-unknown, but its real impact is on how Pacific Rift plays. Like the original MotorStorm, races more often than not feature a number of different classes of vehicles competing at once. Ranging from motorcycles to big rigs, there's a good variety to how the different classes handle, though they all have a certain slippery quality to them. The tracks themselves play off this diversity with constantly diverging paths that are better suited for one class or another. You'll find narrow clearings that only a motorcycle could get through, deep waters that would sink anything other than a mudplugger, or rocky terrain that require the large, soft tires of a monster truck to traverse. <br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/255162-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255162" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/255162-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255162"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5338/255162-2.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Cars!</figcaption></figure>Regardless of what you're driving, or where, engine temperature can be a concern, and riding on the turbo boost for too long will cause your vehicle to explode. You can lower your engine temperature more rapidly by strategically plowing through shallow pools or waterfalls, though close proximity to lava will cause it to rise. It's a pretty minor aspect of the action, but it's something to consider. The surfaces you'll encounter on the track include mud, sand, loose gravel, shallow pools, and volcanic rock, none of which provide particularly reliable traction, regardless of the class of vehicle you're driving. The inability to divert forward momentum into another direction with much precision can be a source of frustration at first, and it's a style of racing that can take some getting used to. It's also one of the defining characteristics of Pacific Rift, and it helps intensify the sense that you're constantly on the verge of flying wildly out of control. <br/><br/>Actually flying wildly out of control, though, isn't as satisfying as it ought be. Vehicles will bust up as you rub against other racers and bits of the environment, earning dents and shedding fenders and bumpers along the way, and your chassis will crunch up like an empty beer can when it slams into an inconveniently placed boulder, but something about it lacks weight. Part of the problem is an inconsistent sense of durability--you can take a jump that drops you a couple hundred feet and keep rolling, but slide into a corner just a little too aggressively and you'll be treated to a slo-mo shot of your vehicle turning into scrap. <br/><br/>Additionally, Pacific Rift doesn't make it explicitly clear which path you should take depending on your vehicle class, and there will be moments when you're on a new track and simply unsure which direction is forward. To its credit, the game takes its time ramping up the difficulty, giving you plenty of time to get accustomed to the flows of the different tracks. Though, with twice the number of tracks as the original MotorStorm had on the disc, each one jam-packed with alternate routes and shortcuts, you could spend a long, long time trying to master all of them. <br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/255185-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255185" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/255185-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255185"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5338/255185-4.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5338/255185-4.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Bikes!</figcaption></figure>The single-player progression in Pacific Rift divides the tracks into four elemental themes--earth, air, fire, and water--though every track features plenty of all four. You can hop between the four sections at will, though the number of races you'll be able to take on are limited to your rank, which is bolstered every time you place in the top three positions. You'll rotate between straight two-lap races, elimination races, and timed checkpoint races, and you'll often have limits put on which classes of vehicles you can choose from. It's not an overly ambitious structure, but it remains lively throughout, and really, the racing speaks for itself.<br/><br/>The online multiplayer gives you a choice between ranked and “casual” races, with ranked races earning you bonuses like new driver skins as you progress. You can choose your track, the number of laps, the time of day, and which vehicle classes you'll allow when you create your own online race, but that's about the extent of the online features. That said, I found the online in Pacific Rift hugely satisfying, largely because of how smooth it runs. Even when racing with the full 12 players, all of them flying around at incredible speeds and barreling into each other, the only thing that made it apparent that I was playing online was the relative aggressiveness of the drivers.<br/><br/>It still doesn't live up to the unreasonable expectations set by those early Sony E3 trailers, but MotorStorm: Pacific Rift feels much, much closer to realizing that vision than its predecessor. As an off-road racing game, the format is simple, but the execution makes for a wild ride.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20451/]]></api_detail_url><id>20451</id><name><![CDATA[MotorStorm: Pacific Rift]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/motorstorm-pacific-rift/3030-20451/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-10 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-76868/]]></api_detail_url><id>76868</id><name><![CDATA[MotorStorm: Pacific Rift]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/motorstorm-pacific-rift-review/1900-82/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-83/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[This first-person parkour game stumbles often, but it does it with style.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/721180-mirrors_edge_okt_7_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-721180" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/721180-mirrors_edge_okt_7_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-721180"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/721180-mirrors_edge_okt_7_3.jpg"/></a><figcaption>It's not all rooftops, though there are still plenty of those.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id="3010-4880" href="/dice/3010-4880" slug="dice">Digital Illusions</a>, the developer behind the <a data-ref-id="3025-51" href="/battlefield/3025-51" slug="battlefield">Battlefield</a> series, is going way, way outside its comfort zone with Mirror's Edge. While it shares a familiar first-person perspective, the focus in Mirror's Edge is less on gunplay, or really, combat of any kind, and more on navigating your environment using acrobatics, free running, <a data-ref-id="3015-272" href="/parkour/3015-272" slug="parkour">parkour</a>, whatever you want to call it. Even if, on a fundamental level, Mirror's Edge isn't that different from a nimble third-person action game like <a data-ref-id="3030-5235" href="/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/3030-5235" slug="prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia</a>, the game's sleek, over-saturated visual style is incredibly striking, and its first-person perspective can prove quite immersive. But the game loses its momentum when it all but forces you into combat situations and when it pits you against precarious jumping puzzles, two common occurrences that turn a viscerally kinetic experience into a tedious pattern of trial and error.<br/><br/>Mirror's Edge takes place in the near-future metropolis of Daily City, a glimmering glass-and-steel corporate dystopia where information control has become so acute that political dissidents use special couriers called runners to relay information. You play as a runner named <a data-ref-id="3005-1422" href="/faith/3005-1422" slug="faith">Faith</a>, and the story revolves around a political assassination that's been pinned on Faith's sister Kate. From there, the game plays out like an aerobic murder mystery, though instead of fingerprints and deerstalker caps, it's lots of rooftop-running and encounters with well-armed private security. There are hints of a greater conspiracy and the high-level corruption that courses through the city, but there's a distinct disconnect between the story and the action, a fault that's exacerbated by the game's awkwardly stylized animated cutscenes. Beyond the facile “I'm just trying to skate here” antiestablishment sentiments and the whistle-clean, hyperrealistic look that comes part-and-parcel with the setting, you don't get a very deep sense for the world of Mirror's Edge.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/368478-scsh551178.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-368478" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/368478-scsh551178.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-368478"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12968/368478-scsh551178.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Mirror's Edge will kick your fear of heights into overdrive.</figcaption></figure> Still, the setup is enough to justify the game's preference of flight over fight, and as a runner, Faith's mobility is her greatest asset. Basic movement works the way you'd expect from a traditional FPS, though all of her jumping and climbing abilities are streamlined into two context-sensitive buttons--one for moving up, one for moving down. The game gets a lot of mileage out of these two buttons which, in the right circumstances, can allow Faith to scramble up walls, quickly leap over short obstacles, slide down ramps and under barriers, run along walls to cross short gaps, slide down zip lines, swing across horizontal bars, shimmy up vertical pipes, and more. You can also combine some of these abilities to perform more advanced moves like the l-jump, which has you running up a wall, quickly spinning around and kicking off, hopefully landing yourself on a higher surface. It's nothing you haven't seen in a third-person action game, but the first-person perspective can make it feel incredibly exotic. <br/><br/>It's not all leapin' ladies, though, as Faith is regularly met by small groups of highly antagonistic guards. She can perform a few different hand-to-hand combat maneuvers, and she can acquire guns by disarming or knocking out enemies, though once she's out of ammo, she'll discard her weapon. For all her agility, Faith is pretty fragile, and on the game's normal difficulty, it only takes a couple hits to put her down. The game encourages you to avoid conflict when possible, though it's not always practical. Mirror's Edge falters when you're forced to go toe-to-toe with your foes, who are consistently tougher and stronger than you. You don't stand a chance if faced with more than one enemy at a time, and even one-on-one your chances aren't great. Disarming an enemy requires just a single button press, and while the ability to slow down time for short bursts can be helpful, it still demands such particular timing, that if you botch it on your first try, chances are you won't live long enough for a second. The game is effective at making guns seem like a crude solution to your problems--partially because they're just not fun to shoot--though there are situations where they're simply the most pragmatic. <br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/368494-scsh550243.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-368494" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/368494-scsh550243.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-368494"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12968/368494-scsh550243.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12968/368494-scsh550243.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>You'd better run.</figcaption></figure> Few first-person games have made full-body dexterity so paramount to the experience as Mirror's Edge, largely because trying to execute precise movement when you can't see your character's body is exceptionally difficult. It's a problem Mirror's Edge isn't immune to, though it goes to some lengths to put as much of Faith on screen as possible. You'll see little bits of Faith's hands pumping into your line of sight when you get a good sprint going, her legs kicking out during a jump and tucking forward during a slide. If you look straight down, you can see pretty much her whole body, making it easy to get right up on a ledge. The most helpful cue is Faith's runner vision, which highlights objects in the environment that are key to your progression in bright red. For the most part, the levels in Mirror's Edge are extremely narrow, usually offering a few minor shortcuts, though most of the time you can hold a button to snap the camera to your next objective when you get lost.<br/><br/>When everything is working right, Mirror's Edge is a sublimely fluid experience. All the little touches--the way the camera will rattle and Faith's breathing will intensify as she runs up to a sprint, the coolly urgent techno music that swells at the right moments--compliment the effortlessness with which Faith can move. As the game progresses, though, taking you from the rooftops of Daily City to its inner clockworks and then back again, the leaps become more death-defying and the jumping puzzles demand more precision. The margin for error shrinks, and the mechanics and perspective can't keep up. It's easy to get disoriented, particularly in tight quarters, and you simply don't have enough information to make your moves. It's frustrating when there's no discernible difference between a failed attempt and a successful one. A jump puzzle or a bunch of guards are taxing enough on their own, but it's not long before the game is throwing both at you at once, and it hardly seems like you have adequate time to figure out your next move. You end up having to throw yourself against the problem, hoping to either luck out or stumble upon the solution. These bouts of trial-and-error grind the game to a halt, though Mirror's Edge also interrupts its own flow with conspicuously long elevator rides, as well as the occasional in-level load.<br/><br/>Consisting of just nine chapters, most of them running well under an hour your first time through, Mirror's Edge is a fleeting experience, though you can play through time trials or speed runs separate from the story. The highs in Mirror's Edge are undeniable, and Digital Illusions deserves credit for some of the bold choices it makes here, but the first-person perspective that helps make it so singular is also its biggest liability. Momentum is the biggest strength of Mirror's Edge, and it's unfortunate that it trips over itself so often.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21213/]]></api_detail_url><id>21213</id><name><![CDATA[Mirror's Edge]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mirrors-edge/3030-21213/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-12 12:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-75394/]]></api_detail_url><id>75394</id><name><![CDATA[Mirror's Edge]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mirrors-edge-review/1900-83/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation 3, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-84/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Red Alert 3 is a funny and smart addition to the Command & Conquer universe.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/179573-redalert3_screen6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-179573" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/179573-redalert3_screen6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-179573"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/380/179573-redalert3_screen6.jpg"/></a><figcaption>You'll do a lot of your fighting on the water.</figcaption></figure>While the original  Command &amp; Conquer line certainly has its share of great, dynamic characters, it's the side story, Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert, that goes the extra mile. With its alternate-history plot line creating a collection of campy concepts like armored attack bears, hovering battle zeppelins, and Tesla-powered weaponry, it manages to give you just enough knowing winks that let you know they're in on the joke without hitting you over the head and essentially saying "hey, look at how funny and clever we are!" Oh, and it's a solid real-time strategy game, too. That's... probably pretty important.<br/><br/><br/> The story in Red Alert gets a big reset in the form of some time machine chicanery. The opening shows you the Soviet leaders, on the verge of defeat as the Allies roll onto Russian soil. Thinking fast, the Russians employ the use of an experimental time machine, go back into time before all of the events of the Red Alert series (which, if you remember, were also caused by a time machine), and eliminate Albert Einstein. With no Einstein, there's no nuclear weaponry, and when the Russians go back to the future, they find that the Soviet forces are no longer on the verge of crumbling. Instead, the Allied forces are down and out. But the feeling of victory doesn't last long, as a new threat emerges as a direct result of the timeline-tampering and the Japanese forces rumble onto the scene to create a three-way conflict.<br/><br/> Three factions and a big-time focus on naval combat are the cornerstones of Red Alert 3. The faction differences are meaningful enough to require you to employ different strategies, but similar enough to where you don't immediately feel like one side has an edge. Each faction builds differently, with the Allies retaining the most C&amp;C-like build system of placing completed structures on the battlefield. The Soviets build structures on the map as soon as they start construction, leaving their structures open to attack while being built. Meanwhile, the Empire of the Rising Sun's technologically advanced forces spit out small core vehicles from their construction yard, which then must be driven to a location and unfurled. There are also differences in how base expansion works, as well as the way the tech trees work and how they distribute to different parts of your base.<br/><br/> The campaign mode takes you through all three factions. Though you can take them on in any order, the game most-logically progresses from the Soviets, then the Allies, and wrapping up with the Empire. Like previous C&amp;C games, you'll find bonus objectives to complete, and the story is told via full-motion video sequences that set up each mission. You'll also get a lot of video during the missions in a window that doesn't block your view of the action. This gives the missions a lot of personality and keeps you engaged in the Red Alert world at all times. All of the FMV and interaction between characters really makes the campaign a treat to see, as you'll encounter a lot of great moments on all sides.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1808/400851-vlcsnap_1903102.png" data-ref-id="1300-400851" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1808/400851-vlcsnap_1903102.png" data-ref-id="1300-400851"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1808/400851-vlcsnap_1903102.png"/></a><figcaption>You'll see a lot of great explosions and other effects as you play.</figcaption></figure>Part of the reason why you'll constantly hear a lot of chatter is that the campaign is built to be played cooperatively. That means that you'll always have a co-commander by your side, be it a human player or an AI-based partner that you can give limited commands to. The AI player seems to hold up its end of the bargain pretty well, too. This is probably the largest gameplay change that Red Alert 3 has, and it's a good one that combines the fun of working together with another player with the more-meaningful missions of the campaign, rather than forcing players who want to cooperate to set up skirmish matches against the AI. The cooperation is also done meaningfully--in some cases your partner will have a base in a different part of the map, making him or her better suited to handle local threats, or letting you coordinate for a multi-pronged offensive.<br/><br/> The large naval component to Red Alert 3 means that you'll see a lot of water-filled levels. Also, every one of the game's multiplayer maps has some sort of water on it. The levels with more water mean you'll have to figure out ways to expand your base onto different islands or use troop transports to ferry around your non-amphibious units. You can also build most of your base at sea, with only the structures devoted to deploying ground units locked to land. This changes a lot of the strategy commonly found in real-time strategy games and really forces you to rethink the best ways to attack. While Red Alert 3 certainly isn't the first RTS to fight at sea, it certainly takes the role of sea combat further than most.<br/><br/> While there's a lot of differences around the edges of Red Alert 3's campaign and unit design, at its core, this is still based on the classic C&amp;C blueprints. You'll build bases, then build barracks and armor. You'll build commando units and sneak them in to destroy bases. You'll build engineers to capture enemy structures. But you probably won't build gigantic forces and slowly build your base to completion before you even think about attacking. It's a fast-moving game, and pumping out small forces of multifunctional units and sending them off to fight seems to be key here, rather than simply entrenching and building up enough units to stomp around the map. As such, expect to see enemies heading your way pretty frequently, too.<br/><br/> Another thing you'll have to constantly consider as you play RA3 is the special abilities of your units. While each one has its core strengths (which are helpfully identified by a series of tooltips you can get by hovering over the build menus), some of them can convert to perform different tasks. Units like the Empire's Mecha Tengu quite literally transform from a two-legged mech that can handle itself against ground-based units to a jet that can take on any airborne invaders. Or there's the Soviets' Apocalypse Tank, which has a secondary mode that fires magnetic harpoons that drag enemy units closer, where they'll be torn up by the tank's grinders. This gives you a lot to think about and manage if you want to be as effective as possible with your units. At times, all that management gets to be a bit much. I found myself getting a little overwhelmed when battles got hectic. But as you play more and more, you'll learn when to employ each strategy in a more calm and collected fashion.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/583358-ra3talent_currycarano.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-583358" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/583358-ra3talent_currycarano.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-583358"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/583358-ra3talent_currycarano.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/583358-ra3talent_currycarano.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>There are a lot of great characters throughout the campaign.</figcaption></figure>So the gameplay is certainly good enough to bear the Red Alert name. But there's also the personality side of things. The FMV sequences get some real star power this time around with the likes of <a data-ref-id="3040-3245" href="/tim-curry/3040-3245" slug="tim-curry"> Tim Curry</a>, <a data-ref-id="3040-15214" href="/george-takei/3040-15214" slug="george-takei"> George Takei</a>, <a data-ref-id="3040-90198" href="/jk-simmons/3040-90198" slug="jk-simmons"> J.K. Simmons</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3040-89955" href="/peter-stormare/3040-89955" slug="peter-stormare"> Peter Stormare</a> all playing key roles. Plenty of other characters, from Jenny McCarthy's Tanya to co-commanders like Oleg, Zhana, Shinzo, or Lissette, also stand out as memorable components to the Red Alert 3 experience.<br/><br/> It helps that the dialogue is well-written and humorous without going too far. The self-serious tone to everything is absolutely key. There's also a lot of unit dialogue, too. While I'm not going to break down a list of everything you'll hear as you play, I will say that there are plenty of little references spread throughout the game, and hearing an Apocalypse Tank reference <a data-ref-id="3005-1" href="/scorpion/3005-1" slug="scorpion"> Scorpion</a> from <a data-ref-id="3025-7" href="/mortal-kombat/3025-7" slug="mortal-kombat"> Mortal Kombat</a> as it drags a unit in for the kill with its magnetic harpoon is always great for a chuckle. The music is also a great component to the audio, from the driving theme of the main menu to the interactive in-mission music that picks up whenever battles commence.<br/><br/> In addition to cooperative play, you can also set up multiplayer matches both online against humans or offline against the AI. Up to six players can compete on the PC, while the Xbox 360 version can handle four. I had a fine time playing skirmish matches against the AI, but as soon as I got online on the PC version, I felt like I truly knew nothing at all about how to play the game and got absolutely stomped by superior players every single time.<br/><br/> The other big story about the Xbox 360 version is that it's essentially the same experience. The game looks very nice when you blow it up on a big screen TV, and the gamepad controls are surprisingly manageable, though there's quite a learning curve if you want to get good at every little nuance and option. The control isn't that different than the 360 version of <a data-ref-id="3030-20494" href="/command-conquer-3-kanes-wrath/3030-20494" slug="command-conquer-3-kanes-wrath"> Kane's Wrath</a>, but there's another layer of refinement here that makes selecting units, deselecting units, and dealing with all of the special unit abilities and top-secret protocol attacks pretty easy to wrap your head around. I suspect that players who don't already have the mouse-and-keyboard controls memorized will have an easier time getting up to speed on the 360. Most of my time was spent retraining myself on how to accomplish common tasks.<br/><br/> While we're talking about the console version, the Xbox 360 doesn't have any matchmaking for co-op games. You'll have to invite someone manually. While it makes sense, since you'd probably only want to play co-op with someone you trust, it also means you'll need to have a friend get a copy of the game and join you. Perhaps you could attempt to make some co-op friends while playing competitive matches.<br/><br/> Red Alert 3 makes compelling changes to the C&amp;C brand of real-time strategy without abandoning the core of what makes these games tick. If you're a longtime fan, that's great news, though if you don't typically go for strategy games, but are still feeling the attraction of the game's stellar cast and full-motion video, you may find that the thrill of the cutscenes isn't quite enough to keep you moving through the missions.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20660/]]></api_detail_url><id>20660</id><name><![CDATA[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/command-conquer-red-alert-3/3030-20660/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-14 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72476/]]></api_detail_url><id>72476</id><name><![CDATA[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/command-conquer-red-alert-3-review/1900-84/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PC, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-85/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe successfully merges the two worlds while also delivering a great new fighting system for the current generation of consoles.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/807856-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-807856" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.54297693920335" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:54.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/807856-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-807856"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/807856-13.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The game's story is all about throwing the different characters together in ways you wouldn't expect.</figcaption></figure>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe sounded like a dicey proposition at best. With the crossover thing having been done by Capcom and Marvel before, it isn't exactly groundbreaking. Plus, the DC Universe license comes along with the baggage of making the game a bit friendly to a younger audience, forcing the series' gruesome finishing moves to be toned down to a more-acceptable level of violence. On top of all that, it's the first time the MK series has come to the current generation of consoles, and with it comes a completely rebuilt fighting system. To say that the deck was stacked against MKvDC is something of an understatement. But all those potential pitfalls make the success of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe that much sweeter. The characters fit together better than expected. The new fighting system is a terrific mix of old and new that makes this the best Mortal Kombat game since the series went 3D. And the finishing moves... well, they're toned down, but even they still manage to put a good exclamation point on a hard-fought victory.<br/></div><br/><div>For the second time in series history, the fighting in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe has been completely revamped. Most of the features and fighting from the previous three console games has been thrown out. Apart from a pair of characters who are armed with blades, there aren't any weapon stances or style changes to worry about. And the combo system ditches ground-based, memorization-heavy combos in favor of timing-focused juggles, which effectively makes it more like the previous 2D games in the series. While you can still sidestep to avoid projectiles at range, the game has a snappy, classic feel to it without feeling like a throwback. One of the few things that carry over from the more-recent 3D entries in the series is the combo breaker, which will crack you out of a jam if you have enough juice in your super meter to use one. You can store up to two breakers if your meter is full. A full meter also lets you enact rage mode, which makes you attack through an opponent's block and not react when you get hit for a few seconds. It's a neat idea that can be effective when playing alone, but most human opponents seem to know to just get away when you pop into rage.</div><br/><div>While the core concept of merging the two worlds together is kind of appealing on their own, it's really the gameplay in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe that makes it stand out. There's a steep learning curve to contend with, and the game doesn't really provide many pointers about how to get better. But once you spend time with it and start to pick up on how it all works, it's fantastic. The fighting manages to feel unlike anything else on the market while still retaining enough Mortal Kombat style to make it appealing to players who are familiar with the series' arcade roots. It also seems to work on multiple levels, rewarding players who take the time to learn and master the more difficult combos while never feeling completely alien. Two players with a passing knowledge of fighting games could probably pick it up and have a decent time, but you get the impression that between the different juggles and things like "pro moves," which are enhanced or branched versions of your special moves that often require very precise timing, there's a lot of appropriately rewarding stuff to pick up as you improve. While it may play quite a bit differently than most of the other fighting games coming out today, it still revolves around the classic balance of knowing what moves are available to you while also deciding when to use specific attacks, or how to block incoming flurries from your opponent.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/582176-mkdc03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-582176" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/582176-mkdc03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-582176"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1570/582176-mkdc03.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Green Lantern, seen here dropping the hammer on Liu Kang.</figcaption></figure>The roster in MKvDC is solid. The MK side is a classic collection of fighters that don't get any newer than <a data-ref-id="3030-3571" href="/mortal-kombat-ii/3030-3571" slug="mortal-kombat-ii">Mortal Kombat II</a>. The DC side mirrors the powers and concepts of the MK fighters a bit, but without feeling like MK moves were cheaply slapped onto the superheroes and villains. That said, Lex Luthor's power armor grants him a wrist flamethrower and missiles that come in both regular and homing varieties, making him a bit like Sektor. Captain Marvel has a Kung Lao-like teleport. The Flash has Kabal's spin dash. The Joker tosses bombs near and far like he was Cyrax. Superman has a Jax-like ground pound, a Nightwolf shoulder charge, and his heat vision matches Kano's eye laser. Batman has a Sheeva-like teleport stomp. Green Lantern uses his ring for a telekinetic lift-and-drop move that comes right out of Ermac's repertoire. Actually, while we're on the subject, it's almost weird that Superman doesn't have Raiden's torpedo move. But if it's any consolation, that move can now be officially referred to as "The Superman" in Raiden's move list. While there are plenty of special moves on the DC fighters that map back to previous MK fighters, they fit the characters that have them really well, so you don't feel like you're just playing MK characters with a DC skin. It all feels pretty legit.</div><br/><div>The game has a more elaborate story mode than you'd expect out of a fighting game, and it's largely in place to give you a good reason why the fighters of Mortal Kombat and the tights-wearing set from DC are getting together for a fight. Much like how the Mortal Kombat series is all about the bad guys trying to merge their horrific realm with Earth, a series of events causes Mortal Kombat's Earthrealm to begin merging with DC's universe. This sets everything in both locations topsy-turvy, as everyone's powers fluctuate and characters begin fighting due to an infection known as "kombat rage." Really, this all seems like it's in place to tell you why a ninja like Sub-Zero could harm Superman with his fists, or why Batman and Wonder Woman would face off.</div><br/><div>The story is split in half, and you choose if you want the MK side or the DC side at the onset. The two stories run concurrently, so you'll see things referenced in one that take place in the other, and so on. They both culminate in a battle against the creepy merged creature that's causing all of this strife in the first place. Interestingly, you don't choose a character in story mode. Instead, it jumps around, devoting each chapter to a different fighter. This serves the alternate purpose of getting you up to speed on how most of the fighters operate. The story sequences themselves have a laugh here and there, but they're also a little hokey in spots. Then again, I tend to find most superhero stuff a bit hokey, anyway. Of course, there's probably something sort of hokey about a martial arts tournament that determines the fate of the world that is fought by movie stars, demons, ice ninjas, and thundergods, so maybe it all balances out. Either way, it works and the tone of it is just fine.</div><br/><div>The game also has a single-player arcade mode, which provides you with the standard MK ladder, culminating in a boss fight and an ending. The endings are in the classic MK style, giving you a couple of static pieces of artwork with some dialogue about what your chosen fighter did after beating the crap out of everyone else. On the practice side of things you can find a standard practice mode and the kombo challenge. This mode gives you ten combos for each fighter that you must complete to succeed. The combos are surprisingly difficult and showcase the tight timing that many of the moves and juggles have. The game doesn't hold your hand at all, which is a bit harsh, especially when you consider that DC fans who don't play many fighters might be coming in only to discover a series of button presses that make absolutely no sense. A proper tutorial and a "show me what this combo you're asking me to do is supposed to look like" button--like the Tekken series has--would have been a good addition.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/656635-mk_9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-656635" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56263048016701" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/656635-mk_9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-656635"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/656635-mk_9.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/656635-mk_9.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Between ice breath, heat vision, and extreme strength, Superman can do a little bit of everything.</figcaption></figure>It's also worth noting that the notorious Xbox 360 directional pad doesn't do the game any favors, especially when it comes to the kombo challenge mode. If you own an arcade stick or some other controller solution, you'll be happy to know that the game lets you freely remap the buttons. You can duplicate all of the game's functionality on six buttons, though the standard three-by-three setup doesn't feel quite right.</div><br/><div>All of these single-player modes are made better by the game's AI. Unlike most MK games, which had bad pattern-based AI that refused to be thrown or only became susceptible to certain attack patterns, the opponents in MKvDC seem to fight fair and use a variety of tactics. It's a great improvement over most of the previous games to bear the Mortal Kombat name. That said, there's no substitute for human opposition.</div><br/><div>You can, of course, play against another person locally. But the game also has online support on both platforms. The player matching is a bit different between the two versions, though. On the 360, you get ranked game and player match options, and unlike most Xbox Live games, there's no "host game" or "join game" options. You just push the "ranked game" button and it finds you someone to play with. Player match works the same way, but you can also just invite friends to join you in these unranked battles. There are also chat rooms that you can join (at least there are in theory--as of this writing, the 360's chat servers are offline). These chat rooms are the only available matching option on the PlayStation 3. You get a list of rooms that seem to each hold up to 100 people. Once in a room, you see a list of players, a window for text chat, and notices whenever a fight ends. You can select another player's name from the room list to issue a challenge, or wait for an incoming challenge, which pops up and lets you accept, decline, or ignore. If you want to find friends, you'll need to agree on which room you want to be in (or create) before you can fight. It's functional, but feels like it fell out of a PlayStation 2 game or something. Some honest-to-goodness automated player matching would have been nice on the PS3 side.</div><br/><div>If you've been playing fighting games online for any length of time, you know how this next part goes. When you have a good connection to the other player, everything works great, and it's not much different from having a player sitting right next to you. But once the latency starts to rise, the game gets pretty glitchy. You trade hits and knock opposing players out of moves more frequently in laggy matches, as the game is trying to figure out who hit whom without causing the action to slow down. Considering the number of disorienting, direction-changing moves that are in the game, as well as the razor-sharp timing required for some of the combos, it becomes a very different game when your connection isn't prime.</div><br/><div>At the end of a fight, the game still shouts "finish him!" Well, if you're fighting Wonder Woman, Catwoman, Sonya, or Kitana, I guess it actually shouts "finish her!" But you get the point. The game has finishing moves in it. With its T-for-Teen rating, though, you won't see Jax crushing skulls with his arms. Instead, he just claps his hands on either side of a victim's head, and they go down, head intact. The DC heroes that wouldn't normally kill their enemies instead perform "heroic brutalities." This is really just a matter of semantics, though. It really just means that after doing something horrible to the other fighter, that fighter wriggles around a little bit as if to say "see? No one died here today!" The finishers do still serve their purpose, though, and that's to put something extra on the end of a fight to make a loss a bit more humiliating. It's funny, the actual moves and animations of the finishers aren't that different--it's just that no one explodes into a cloud of blood or a mountain of rib cages at the end.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/771882-mkdcp3078.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-771882" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/771882-mkdcp3078.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-771882"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/771882-mkdcp3078.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/771882-mkdcp3078.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>I'd rather have two combo breakers than rage, but hey, to each his own.</figcaption></figure>Personally, I didn't find the lack of M-rated violence to be that big of a deal. Even when fatalities are present, they're only really meaningful for the first month or so, when they're fresh and new. After that, everyone's seen them all, and they only serve to make the downtime between fights longer. But it all comes back to why you're personally interested in Mortal Kombat. For some people, the action is the juice. For others, it's all about the gory displays at the end of the fight. For what it's worth, the game does have blood during fights, so hits to the face will result in a bit of splatter. Also, clothing gets ripped up as you get beaten, resulting in some great-looking scuffs and scrapes at the end of the fight.</div><br/><div>The game has a good number of backgrounds that reflect the game's storyline nicely. Some of them have a huge beam of energy down the middle that reflects the merging worlds, so one side of the line is a Mortal Kombat location and the other is a DC location, like Shang Tsung's island and Wonder Woman's home, Themyscira. You'll also see the Batcave, Superman's Fortress of Solitude, the torn-up streets of Metropolis, and so on.</div><br/><div>The audio holds up its end of the bargain with appropriately intense music and the loud thumps and cracks of hand-to-hand combat. Moves like uppercuts and ground slams are accompanied by some great, deep bass that will shake your surroundings if you're appropriately equipped. While there's plenty of great new sound, there's also some old stuff. Raiden's superman move features the same, classic, unintelligible speech that it always has. Scorpion's "get over here" and "come here" also sound like they could have come from previous games. The announcer is also the same voice you've heard in the past several games. I could have gone for a new announcer this time around, but everything else seems just fine. There's also a lot more speech in the game to accompany the story's cutscenes. The character voices don't always perfectly match the look of the characters, but they're right on more often than not.</div><br/><div>Given the way the last few MK games have gone in terms of redesigning the core concepts of the fighting and presenting a cast of characters that weren't as memorable as the ones that debuted back in the 2D days, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe feels like the refreshing start of a new era for Midway's fighting series. It probably won't change your mind if you're not into the genre, or even if you're into the genre but have already made up your mind about the MK series. But if you're open to the idea of more Mortal Kombat, you'll find a terrific game here.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20449/]]></api_detail_url><id>20449</id><name><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe/3030-20449/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-17 13:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72346/]]></api_detail_url><id>72346</id><name><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe-review/1900-85/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-86/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[A shortage of content is the only thing keeping this unique cooperative zombie shooter from eating you alive.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811694-l4d_hospital01_apartment0226__.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811694" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811694-l4d_hospital01_apartment0226__.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811694"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/811694-l4d_hospital01_apartment0226__.jpg"/></a><figcaption>You know as much as you need to about Francis here just by looking at him.</figcaption></figure>In most first-person shooters, there's a fine distinction between the single- and multiplayer games, a distinction that <a data-ref-id="3010-1374" href="/valve-corporation/3010-1374" slug="valve-corporation"> Valve</a>'s Left 4 Dead does its best to obliterate. This is a case where the campaign, online co-op, and online multiplayer modes all bleed together into a delightfully putrid miasma of first-person zombie panic. For all the games that have used zombies as foils, Left 4 Dead is probably the closest a video game has gotten to recreating the oscillating senses of dread and terror that are fundamental to a good zombie movie. It makes for one of the most thrilling and unique shooter experiences you'll have this year, as well as one of the most authentic, kinetic zombie games ever made. <br/><br/>The beauty of Left 4 Dead is that it taps into a vision of the zombie apocalypse that is so familiar from films that it allows for a frightening economy in the way the game establishes its characters and setting. The game opens up “two weeks after first infection” with a brief cinematic of the four survivors amidst a horde of attacking zombies, and it's the closest the game comes to providing out-and-out exposition. The lack of further explanation of how the zombie pandemic started actually works to the game's advantage, as confusion and the fear of the unknown are two of the greatest strengths of a good zombie scenario. On a practical level, you'll be so concerned with simply surviving that any other concerns quickly fall by the wayside. <br/><br/>There are some blurbs in the game's manual that provide a little more back story for the four survivors, but they're all so archetypal in appearance and behavior--though without feeling generic--that you get a great sense of who these people are simply by interacting with them. The game also uses the state of the world itself to drive home just how bad things have gotten. Alternating between city streets, open wilderness, and other hallmarks of modern civilization such as hospitals and airports, this is a world that you know, albeit one scattered with the debris of previous carnage where civil services have broken down all but completely, and anyone still alive has boarded themselves up inside buildings and armed themselves to the teeth. <br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811696-l4d_hospital01_apartment1322__.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811696" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811696-l4d_hospital01_apartment1322__.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811696"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/811696-l4d_hospital01_apartment1322__.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Zambies!</figcaption></figure>One of my favorite parts of Left 4 Dead is the safe rooms, where previous survivors have scrawled messages to loved ones, contradicting details about other safe locations, tallies of zombies killed, and darkly comic boastings like “no zombie is safe from Chicago Ted.” Even though you never see another non-zombie over the course of the game, the world seems familiar and lived-in. In a way, Left 4 Dead is a kindred spirit with <a data-ref-id="3030-21170" href="/portal/3030-21170" slug="portal"> Portal</a>, another Valve-produced game that relies on inference and non-intrusive means to establish the bigger picture.<br/><br/>The campaign mode consists of four independent scenarios, the objectives for which are consistent throughout: survival. You'll start out stranded in one location, surrounded by the undead, and you'll fight from one safe house to the next, working your way towards a destination where you'll presumably find rescue. Between points A and B, you'll find yourself in a world undulating with mobs of shuffling, “common” zombies who, if left to their own devices, will usually just ignore you. If you shoot a zombie, or disturb them by operating machinery or accidentally set off a car alarm, they'll snap to attention and start sprinting towards you with the singular focus of tearing you to shreds. In small groups, these brown-label zombies don't pose much of a threat, though the game will regularly try to overwhelm you with hordes of them, which is a simply terrifying sight. <br/><br/>Of greater concern are the breeds of special zombies, who are tougher than the regular horde, and who come with some unique and deadly abilities. Boomers are corpulent, dyspeptic blobs who can hit survivors with a blast of vomit that both blinds them and causes them to attract a horde of zombies. The smoker tends to hang out further away from the main path, using its long tongue to drag survivors towards it. The hunter is a quick and nimble zombie who, when close enough, will pounce on a survivor and maul them. The tank is a hulking, thick-skinned beast that will tear up hunks of concrete and hurl them from afar, and it only takes one or two punches from one of these to incapacitate a survivor. Each of these special zombies require the use of specific tactics, though none are as dangerous or unique as the witch, who appears to be a thin wisp of a girl who, if left undisturbed, will simply sit on the ground and whimper plaintively. But if you get too close, shine your flashlight on her, or, God forbid, shoot her, she turns into a screaming whirlwind of deadly claws that can be quite difficult to put down. The game constantly encourages you to avoid the witch at all costs, and with good reason.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811704-l4d_byebyeairliner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811704" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.38515625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:38.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811704-l4d_byebyeairliner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811704"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/811704-l4d_byebyeairliner.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/811704-l4d_byebyeairliner.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Just another day in the zombie apocalypse.</figcaption></figure>Forward momentum is critical to survival, though there are several points in each scenario where you'll find yourself trapped, with no recourse but to try and outlast the swarms of the undead before you can progress. Similarly, the scenarios culminate in a dramatic last stand, where you're forced to fend off wave after wave of zombies from a specific location as you await the arrival of your rescuers. Regardless of where you are, survivors need to stick together. A straggler makes a fine target for a hunter or a smoker, and once they've snared you, the only way you're getting out is with the help of another survivor. Other survivors can also heal you with their own first-aid kits, give you pain pills, and lift you up off the ground when you're incapacitated. The co-op nature of Left 4 Dead is a blade that cuts both ways, in that your explicit reliance on other players can make the experience both more satisfying and frustrating. The alternative is to play with some surprisingly competent computer controlled survivors. While the AI features a few quirks, such as their tendency to not pick up pipe bombs and molotovs, as well as the occasional problem negotiating doorways, they're not nearly as prone to accidentally shoot their teammates, and they're extremely attentive when you get pinned down or incapacitated. The lack of flesh-and-blood teammates evens out the experience, tamping down both the highs and the lows.<br/><br/>There's also a versus mode which pits two teams of four against each other--one as the survivors, and one as the zombies--with the roles alternating between rounds. Save for the increased difficulty of playing against live opponents, playing as the survivors isn't much different from the campaign mode, though playing as the zombies is an entirely different experience. Zombies aren't anywhere near as resilient as the survivors, but while the survivors have only one life per round, zombies can spawn repeatedly. With each life, you're randomly assigned to a different type of special zombie--either boomer, smoker, hunter, or tank--before you're allowed to choose your spawn point, preferably near the survivors, though the game puts a limit on how close you can spawn. Stalking your prey and coordinating with your zombie teammates makes this the antithesis of the survivor experience, and the presence of plenty of common zombies keeps the versus mode feeling true to the campaign. It's a shame that, for some inexplicable reason, only two of the four maps that Left 4 Dead ships with can be played in the versus mode, simply because it's so much fun.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811706-l4d_rooftopfire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811706" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.62512613521695" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811706-l4d_rooftopfire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811706"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/811706-l4d_rooftopfire.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/811706-l4d_rooftopfire.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>A well-placed molotov is a good way to deal with the teeming undead masses.</figcaption></figure>The basic movement speed in Left 4 Dead is pretty fast, and while this isn't a game that demands pinpoint accuracy with your weapons, you never feel like the game is taking it easy on you. A big part of this is thanks to the game's AI director. Depending on both the set difficulty level and how well you've been playing the game so far, it will change up when, where, and how many zombies get spawned, as well as the placement of random items like first-aid kits, pain pills, molotov cocktails, and pipe bombs. Prior to the game's release, Valve has put a lot of focus on how radically the AI director can affect the play experience from one session to the next, and while each scenario features a few alternate paths, the consistency of your objectives restrain its influence to specific beats rather than the overall rhythm. This would be a complete non-issue, except that with just four scenarios, each taking roughly an hour to complete, it doesn't take long to see everything Left 4 Dead has to offer. The reactive nature of the AI director and the variables inherent to the game's multiplayer focus give these scenarios longer legs than they might have otherwise, but you'll still wish there was more to it. In a way, it's a credit to how well-crafted the scenarios are that you come away hungry for more.<br/><br/>As with <a data-ref-id="3030-17729" href="/the-orange-box/3030-17729" slug="the-orange-box"> The Orange Box</a>, Left 4 Dead features a developer commentary mode which places brief bits of audio commentary throughout the game. The delivery can be a little dry at times, and it might be a little too nuts-and-bolts for some, though the insight provided into the process behind the game, as well as how the choices made have an impact on the final product, are consistently fascinating.<br/><br/>Left 4 Dead runs on the Source engine, the same engine that powered <a data-ref-id="3030-1539" href="/half-life-2/3030-1539" slug="half-life-2"> Half-Life 2</a> some four years ago. It's definitely getting a little long in the tooth, but it still puts on a pretty good show here. The game's smart use of lighting, film-grain effects, and various, subtle contrast and color effects give much of the world a desolate, washed-out feeling. The character models feature some of the most realistic, emotive faces I've seen in a game, and the stride of their animations will change depending on their current condition, to the point that you don't even have to look a a survivor's health bar to know how they're doing. There are some quirks, with interactions between characters being pretty consistently awkward, but the game's art direction is so thoroughly engrossing that the problems are easy to ignore.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811707-left4dead_2008_10_13_16_59_21_41.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811707" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/811707-left4dead_2008_10_13_16_59_21_41.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811707"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/811707-left4dead_2008_10_13_16_59_21_41.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/811707-left4dead_2008_10_13_16_59_21_41.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Come give your Aunt Clara a kiss!</figcaption></figure>The sound in Left 4 Dead plays a deceptively subtle role in both the mood and the gameplay. The feral screeches of the zombies are unsettlingly animalistic, and the ways in which the survivors will shout out to each other conveys their varying levels of desperation. The music is also damned effective, employing eerie synthesized tones straight out of a John Carpenter movie to create a dangerous level of tension, and building up to some ominous horns whenever the action is about to get serious. It's not all window-dressing, though, and with a keen ear you'll be able to identify the presence of a special zombie before you'll actually see them. This is of particular importance when dealing with the witch.<br/><br/>The PC and Xbox 360 versions are pretty comparable across the board, though there are a few predictable deviations, such as the higher resolutions afforded by the PC hardware and the sharper controls of a mouse and keyboard. Communication with your team is key in Left 4 Dead, and while the PC version supports voice chat, it's not as standardized as it is on the 360, and you can't expect every player to have a headset. While the PC version features a quick dialogue tree that lets you call out a few specific phrases, it's no substitute for direct communication.<br/><br/>Due to the mere four scenarios included in Left 4 Dead, the biggest factor in deciding between the two versions will be post-release support. The standalone nature of the scenarios would make it easy for Valve and/or the community to cook up some new and exciting levels, which could extend the life of the game considerably. The Xbox 360 version is still terrific fun, though the limited post-release support that Valve has provided for the contents of The Orange Box on the 360, compounded by the inability of players to distribute their own custom maps, potentially gives the PC version a distinct advantage.<br/><br/>Beyond its categorical success in establishing a vivid picture of the zombie apocalypse, Left 4 Dead's biggest breakthrough is the way it blurs the lines between the often compartmentalized pieces of a modern first-person shooter. It makes for a game that's unlike any other, and while the limited amount of content is admittedly unfortunate, that shouldn't keep you from experiencing this fast-paced, nerve-wracking game.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20690/]]></api_detail_url><id>20690</id><name><![CDATA[Left 4 Dead]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/left-4-dead/3030-20690/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-18 10:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-74118/]]></api_detail_url><id>74118</id><name><![CDATA[Left 4 Dead]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/left-4-dead-review/1900-86/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PC, Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-87/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Inventive, hilarious, inexpensive, and tons of fun--that's Nuts & Bolts in a nutshell.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1212/646373-54631320080911_163743_7_big.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-646373" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1212/646373-54631320080911_163743_7_big.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-646373"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1212/646373-54631320080911_163743_7_big.jpg"/></a><figcaption>This is probably not the Banjo game you were expecting.</figcaption></figure>It was only a matter of time before Rare brought its cutesy platforming series Banjo-Kazooie to the Xbox 360. At some point in the development process, however, a wise person realized the world might not need yet another cutesy platformer, so instead we've got Nuts &amp; Bolts, an irreverent, self-aware, open-world, vehicle-based, Tinkertoy-workshop action game. That's a lot of adjectives, but I'd happily swap them all out for a single one like "stupendous." If you'd told me I would ever like a Banjo-Kazooie game so much, I would have called you crazy. But for numerous reasons I sincerely love this one.<br/><br/>Before I ever got into the unique mechanics that make this such a fun game to <em>play</em>, Nuts &amp; Bolts grabbed me with its bold, batty, referential, self-deprecating sense of humor. The game pokes fun at itself and the Banjo series constantly, with references to the "lame" storylines in the original Banjo games and the fact <a data-ref-id="3005-177" href="/mario/3005-177" slug="mario">"that Italian gentleman"</a> has sold far more games in his time. The lampoon job extends to the entire video game industry, with constant jabs at Rare and its other franchises, the Xbox 360, the Frag Dolls, and a lot more. Every cutscene, exchange of dialogue, and mission description is sharper, wittier, and funnier than it has any business being in a <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> game, of all things. The game can be downright hilarious.<br/><br/>This sort of fourth-wall-busting metahumor is personified in the game's excellent new character the Lord of Games, a self-important set of hovering purple robes with a Pong-emblazoned TV for a face who claims to be the creator of every single video game ever made. At the beginning, Banjo and Kazooie are hanging out on Spiral Mountain, fat and out of work since their last outing eight years ago. Along comes the severed head of Gruntilda, the series' witchy antagonist, looking for trouble again. But before they can square off to see who can collect the most pointless items the fastest, in comes the Lord of Games to restore Banjo's fitness, give Grunty a new mechanical body, and send them off to a hub world called Showdown Town in a race to...collect a different kind of pointless item. The game gleefully wears this sort of game-design irony right on its sleeve.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/813270-banjonutsbolts_workshop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813270" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/813270-banjonutsbolts_workshop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813270"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/813270-banjonutsbolts_workshop.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The workshop is easy to use and adds a ton to the gameplay.</figcaption></figure>L.O.G. creates a handful of different-themed game worlds you can enter from Showdown Town, and in each of them you'll find the same roster of Banjo characters like Mumbo, Humba Wumba, Bottles, and Klungo waiting to dispense missions that each yield a jiggy (a jigsaw puzzle piece that's the Banjo equivalent of Mario's stars). This isn't your typical assortment of generic ice worlds and desert worlds, though. There's LOGBox 720, where you explore the innards of a gigantic "next-next gen" game console. The Jiggoseum is a sort of Olympic stadium full of athletic challenges. Banjoland is like a comical museum of past Banjo games and historical event all smashed into one small space. The Terrarium of Terror is a vaguely sci-fi-themed glass enclosure full of aliens and gigantic fungi. Plenty more opportunities for jokes go along with each of these worlds, and the game smartly makes the most of them. The first time you enter a world, you get a TV sitcom-style intro with all the Banjo characters playing different comical roles (Humba Wumba is "The Long-Suffering Wife" in the "Green Acres" knock-off) and expertly produced theme music that instantly calls to mind the sort of show that's being aped.<br/><br/>Funny writing and varied game worlds are all well and good, but it's the vehicle-building feature that really sets Banjo apart from other character-driven action games. Make no mistake: This is not a platformer, certainly not in the style of the old Banjo games. You can run and jump, climb on ledges, and walk tightropes--and there's a good number of collectible notes to jump around collecting--but almost all of your traveling and mission action will be done in vehicles.<br/><br/>The workshop is where you can put together all kinds of wild-looking, multifunctional vehicles from generic parts you can find and purchase as you go. The vehicle-building is really easy to get a handle on, and you can intuit how a vehicle is going to perform just based on the parts you add. If you slap a jet engine and a pair of wings on your racing car, you can expect it to fly. An airplane with a couple of inflatable floaters attached to each side can double as a boat. There are gadgets and doohickeys for pushing, carrying, sucking, blowing, and a myriad of other functions. You can get egg shooters, laser guns, homing missiles, energy shields, and a lot more to extend the functionality of your car-plane-boat. Engines and propellers need fuel tanks, and weapons need ammo holders; these things are also easy to figure out and attach. Luckily, there's no rating for aesthetics, because it's easy to make a really horrendous-looking vehicle that just happens to do all the things you need it to do. You can save these blueprints and trade them on Xbox Live with your friends, too.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1212/646392-54631320080911_163744_10_big.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-646392" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1212/646392-54631320080911_163744_10_big.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-646392"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1212/646392-54631320080911_163744_10_big.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1212/646392-54631320080911_163744_10_big.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>There are almost as many types of missions as there are possible vehicles.</figcaption></figure>Initially, I got frustrated with some of the game's vehicle controls, and I suspect most other people will too. But it's not that they're bad; it's simply a consequence of different parts being used together inappropriately. Too many engines on a light car with basic tires will make you fishtail and spin out constantly. But if you add more weight and replace those tires with the high-grip variety, the driving will get way more manageable. So it's more about getting a feel for how the vehicle systems work together and how to tweak out your various rides to get the specific sort of handling and performance you're looking for.<br/><br/>Don't think the vehicle-building is a throwaway feature only die-hard gearheads will get into. It's as integral to the mission-based action as it is easy to get into. There's an enormous variety of mission types available here, all designed around the things you can accomplish with a properly designed vehicle. Various missions will task you with moving cargo, getting into different kinds of combat, running checkpoint races (on land, sea, and/or air), playing soccer, demolishing an igloo, watering some giant seeds, winning a vehicular long-jump contest, knocking down dominoes, running an aerial taxi service... The point is, there's a huge number of different mission objectives. I had around 85 jiggies when I went to finish the game, and didn't feel like I'd ever really done the exact same mission twice.<br/><br/> All that variety is due to how flexible and extensive the vehicle options are. I can't count the number of times I had a problem beating a particular mission, only to go back into the editor and build a better vehicle more suited to the current task that made finishing the mission much easier. That even happened with the game's final boss, which I thought was unreasonably difficult after I failed to beat it over and over. Half an hour in the workshop and I emerged with a new bruiser of a combat vehicle that I used to trounce the boss on my first try. You feel like your ingenuity is really being rewarded when you dig deep into the vehicle possibilities and find more effective (and in some cases, entirely new) ways to approach a particular task. In fact, you'll <em>have</em> to make use of the workshop, as the missions get harder and harder and you'll soon hit a wall you simply can't pass with the stock vehicles. If you truly don't want to build your own, you can purchase blueprints for new pre-made vehicles that become available as you get more and more jiggies. But that would be missing out on half of the fun. I personally enjoyed starting with the stock blueprints and tweaking different vehicles out to meet my current needs.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7523/199480-bknutsnbolts_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-199480" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7523/199480-bknutsnbolts_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-199480"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7523/199480-bknutsnbolts_01.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7523/199480-bknutsnbolts_01.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The game worlds are varied and very nice to look at.</figcaption></figure>You need 75 jiggies out of the total of 131 to access L.O.G.'s video game factory for the final showdown with Gruntilda. Each of the game worlds is divided into six acts, and each act unlocks based on the total number of jiggies you have, so even when you've opened up all the game worlds, you'll still be opening up new things to do in the old ones. This lets the designers offer harder missions in subsequent acts of each world, so you're given plenty of reasons to visit and revisit all of the game worlds repeatedly as you bank more jiggies in the town square.<br/><br/> Even after you hit 75 jiggies and go fight the last boss, you can keep tooling around to get the remaining 60 or so jiggies from the missions you haven't finished. You can also earn a special trophy for meeting more stringent requirements in each mission than it takes to simply earn a jiggy. Amassing enough trophies will give you even more jiggies, as well as some other achievements, so there's a lot of incentive to go back and replay old missions once you have better vehicles. There are also a good number of ingenious one-off achievements that make you use specialized vehicles to interact with the game worlds' environments in unique ways. ("BBQ Beef" wants you to ferry a cow into the volcano in Nutty Acres, for instance.) Showdown Town also offers lots of side activities and hidden items, including an amusing 8-bit-style side-scrolling arcade game developed by Klungo. In short, there's a lot to do in between missions and after you've beaten the final boss.<br/><br/>The game makes it easy to replay finished missions from a simple menu. Actually, the game makes it easy to access everything. You can change vehicles or enter the workshop at any time from the pause menu. If you ever get separated from your vehicle, you can hold down a button to warp right back to it. These shortcuts are just, well, pleasant. They could have made you return to Showdown Town and visit the physical location of Mumbo's Motors every time you wanted to build, but what would be the point? The game tests your skill when it needs to, but not your patience when it doesn't.<br/><br/>Outside the main game, there's a full online multiplayer mode that takes some of the mission activities from the single-player game and turns them into sports- and racing-themed minigames. This multiplayer mode has full support for ranked matches, Halo-style parties, custom game rules, and so on. I didn't find these quite as compelling as the in-game missions without the carrot-on-a-stick goal of more jiggies, or the ability to tweak vehicles on the fly (though you can use your own designs in some of the minigames if the host sets that option). But the multiplayer is still well-constructed and entertaining for when you're done with the core game.<br/><br/> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7523/199530-bknutsnbolts_20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-199530" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7523/199530-bknutsnbolts_20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-199530"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7523/199530-bknutsnbolts_20.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7523/199530-bknutsnbolts_20.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Cheer up, bear! Your game is awesome.</figcaption></figure>Your appreciation for Rare's trademark art style is an entirely subjective issue, but I feel comfortable asserting Nuts &amp; Bolts is at least a technically beautiful game. There are a lot of enormous, well-rendered environments that you can drive, sail, and fly around, and each one contains plenty of little touches that go along with the video-game-within-a-video-game theme. If you fly too close to the edges in the verdant outdoor zone Nutty Acres, for instance, you'll see little scan lines behind the sky reminding you that none of it is real. All the characters have silly, exaggerated animations that give them a lot of character in the absence of voice acting, too. The frame rate can get a little jerky from time to time, mostly when you're driving a boat around in the water, but that's rare and not a very big deal. Rare's talented composers are also in full effect here, including <a data-ref-id="3030-20682" href="/viva-pinata-trouble-in-paradise/3030-20682" slug="viva-pinata-trouble-in-paradise">Viva Pinata</a> maestro <a data-ref-id="3040-50661" href="/grant-kirkhope/3040-50661" slug="grant-kirkhope">Grant Kirkhope</a> in his Rare swan song performance. There are some classic Banjo themes, as well as plenty of jaunty new melodies that underscore all the game's goofy, irreverent goings on.<br/><br/>Funny, inventive, gorgeous--and cheap. Microsoft decided to charge a mere $40 for Nuts &amp; Bolts, but I got more laughs and more satisfying gameplay out of this one than most of the $60 games I've played this year. And even after spending nearly 20 hours amassing enough jiggies to take down the final boss, I'm compelled to get back in there and keep playing new missions, unlocking new vehicle parts, and exploring more of the game's beautiful world. I had no affection whatsoever for the Banjo-Kazooie franchise or characters going into Nuts &amp; Bolts, but its list of great qualities quietly won me over to make it one of my favorite Xbox 360 games of the year.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20586/]]></api_detail_url><id>20586</id><name><![CDATA[Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts/3030-20586/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-19 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-77298/]]></api_detail_url><id>77298</id><name><![CDATA[Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Brad]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts-review/1900-87/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-88/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Wrath of the Lich King provides even more reason to continue playing a four-year-old game.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><em>[EDITOR'S NOTE] When we decided that we wanted to cover Wrath of the Lich King, we determined that an expansion review like this one would only really be useful to people who are still playing World of Warcraft--or people who played a lot of it and stopped, but might be interested in coming back. Since the four of us haven't played World of Warcraft in ages, we decided to enlist the assistance of the upstairs technical crew. Andy McCurdy has been playing World of Warcraft since the beginning with no serious breaks, so we figured he'd be the best guy to figure out if the new stuff Blizzard added is worth your time.</em><br/><br/> Give or take, Wrath of the Lich King marks World of Warcraft's fourth birthday. Think back to what you were doing in 2004. You were probably into the Xbox or PlayStation 2, and perhaps you were really excited about that Halo sequel that all the kids were playing. Maybe you were a little ahead of the curve and were waiting patiently for God of War, which would ship the following Spring. Point being, it's been a long time since World of Warcraft's initial release. But over those four years, Warcraft has changed. It's almost turned into a platform unto itself, with the kind of monthly improvements that other MMO developers have often talked about but never get around to implementing. But Blizzard's good ideas have a way of actually making it into their game, a trend that continues with this latest expansion. Wrath of the Lich King implements a mess of cool improvements, pushing the game forward and further cementing World of Warcraft's place at the very top of the genre.<br/></div><br/><div> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4362/710978-lickkingingame.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-710978" data-size="medium" data-ratio="1.2323943661972" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:123.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4362/710978-lickkingingame.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-710978"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4362/710978-lickkingingame.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The Lich King Arthas beckons you to his icy realm of Northrend.</figcaption></figure> While there are plenty of meaty gameplay changes to consider, the most major improvement that Wrath brings to the world is in its story. This expansion elevates the delivery of lore in World of Warcraft via a new set of real-time cinematics, player-perspective landscapes that change as a result of your actions, and inventive new quest designs. A large number of the newly available quests surround the story of <a data-ref-id="3005-636" href="/arthas-menethil/3005-636" slug="arthas-menethil">Arthas</a>, the fallen knight who originally appeared in Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, and the land of <a data-ref-id="3035-87" href="/northrend/3035-87" slug="northrend">Northrend</a>. The game doesn't expect you to remember the events of Warcraft III, though; a suitable amount of backstory on these events is also included.<br/></div><br/><div>One of the most exciting elements of Lich King's quests is that some them give you the feeling that you're actually changing pieces of the landscape. One quest produces an in-game cinematic of an epic fight with the Scourge, the fall of an Alliance hero, and the devastation of a town. From then on, players who have completed this quest see the area as completely devastated from the battle, while others continue to see the land whole, as it was previous to the encounter. This epic feeling of taking part in larger world events continues as you fight alongside notable computer-controlled faction leaders, rampaging and invading a player-controlled town. This is a key point--Lich King actually makes you care about the fates of the world's NPCs by having you fight alongside them against other human players. These NPCs are further fleshed out and made meaningful via some terrific voice acting from key characters in the more-meaningful quests. These elements add a lot of character to the experience.<br/></div><br/><div>Wrath of the Lich King also adds World of Warcraft's first new class, the <a data-ref-id="3015-399" href="/death-knight/3015-399" slug="death-knight">Death Knight</a>. Denoted as a "hero class," you can only create a Death Knight if you have a character that is already level 55. Death Knights start at level 55 and come equipped with a full set of rare gear. While forcing players to have a level 55 character establishes a decent barrier to entry, it hasn't completely stopped the "new-class-itis" that typically infects an MMO when a new character class is added to the game.

A rather entertaining series of beginning quests will quickly elevate you from the starting level of 55 up to around 58 or so, providing a steady stream of talent points that will expose you to the class' new abilities faster than a traditional new character would. Still, the additional abilities come at a gradual and manageable pace. The final quest in this starting line contains a satisfying in-game cinematic that also serves as the severance of the bond between the Lich King Arthas and your Death Knight. At this point, you're free to travel to other areas in the world.<br/></div><br/><div> As far as abilities are concerned, Death Knights focus their power through runes which are embedded onto their weapons. There are three types of runes: Blood, Frost and Unholy. Each of these match up to a corresponding talent tree. Death Knights have two of each rune type, which are consumed by their special abilities. For example, the Death Strike ability costs one Unholy rune and one Frost rune. Runes restore their power 10 seconds after being used, so playing a Death Knight requires some micromanagement of which abilities you want to use in which order. Given that only seasoned players can even create a Death Knight, this setup is a skill-based way to make the class fun and unique.<br/></div><br/><div>Inscription is the new profession featured in Wrath of the Lich King. Inscribers can create glyphs that enhance the skills and spells of other players. Each player can have three major and three minor glyphs. Major glyphs enhance a skill or spell by increasing its potency, such as increasing the damage it causes, the healing it does, or the duration of the effect. Minor glyphs add smaller gains to less-used spells, or provide novelty effects to existing abilities. Mages with the minor glyph of polymorph, for example, will now transform their target into a penguin instead of a sheep.</div><br/><div>Blizzard has overhauled the other professions quite a bit, providing a direct benefit to the players who've leveled up their professions. For example, enchanters receive item enhancements that can be used only on their items, and blacksmiths receive the ability to add sockets to their existing armor. Even gathering professions have benefited from these changes. Miners receive a buff to hit points for all the sweat they've put in, herbalists receive an area-of-effect healing wave where flowers grow from the ground, and experienced skinners receive an added chance to critically strike opponents in combat.</div><br/><div><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5469/804355-wowscrnshot_111308_090747.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-804355" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.6" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5469/804355-wowscrnshot_111308_090747.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-804355"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5469/804355-wowscrnshot_111308_090747.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5469/804355-wowscrnshot_111308_090747.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>There are a lot of unique scripted missions that add variety to the questing.</figcaption></figure>Although not a unique idea, Wrath of the Lich King has introduced an achievement system that is incredibly fleshed out with nearly a thousand achievements available for players to unlock. All achievements are worth points that contribute to a player's overall total, while some harder-to-obtain achievements also provide special mounts or status titles. One example involves killing all four opposing NPC faction leaders (no easy feat), which rewards you with a pretty bitchin' black war bear to use as a mount. Players can compare their achievements with other players at any time. The only issue with the achievement system is that it isn't retroactive for anything other than quests, so you might find yourself doing a lot of stuff over again just for the sake of achievements. Really want that war bear? You better get yourself and 50 others to <a data-ref-id="3035-80" href="/undercity/3035-80" slug="undercity">the Undercity</a> at 4am...again.</div><br/><div>The game also introduces some other fun, just-for-kicks additions, like a barber shop where you can change your hair style, hair color, and facial hair. Tired of your old look? Have a hair color that doesn't go with your cool new gear? No worries, just fork over 10 gold for a whole new look. Oh yeah, and getting a haircut is an achievement, too. Just like real life!</div><br/><div>As usual, Blizzard has absorbed some player-made tools and interface mods and made those concepts official parts of the game client. With Wrath, players now have access to a calendaring system to keep track of special events and gatherings. That might sound silly to a less-serious player, but if you've been playing World of Warcraft long enough to get this deep into the game, you probably understand how important it can be to stay organized with your posse. This calendar is available both in-game and on the WOW website, which is handy.</div></div><br/><div><div>Generally speaking, a lot of the changes that have been made in Wrath are great at making the game more accessible. You can tell that Blizzard learned a lot from the release of the previous expansion, The Burning Crusade. For example, BC had all the players funnel to one starting zone to begin their climb to level 70. This caused big bottlenecks and made some quests hard to complete because two million other adventurers were trying to do the exact same thing during the first few weeks of release. Wrath provides two starting areas for players in the new area of Northrend, and the areas have a lot of different branches that give you different ways to get up to level 80. Also, access to Northrend has been made very apparent with a boat that leaves from Azeroth's major cities, rather than having players quest out to the little-visited Blasted Lands to teleport to the new areas, as in Burning Crusade.</div><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8572/497187-wowscrnshot_061608_015245.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-497187" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8572/497187-wowscrnshot_061608_015245.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-497187"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8572/497187-wowscrnshot_061608_015245.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8572/497187-wowscrnshot_061608_015245.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Instances now come in both 25-man and more-casual 10-man versions.</figcaption></figure>Wrath also expands on the scripted quests previously introduced in the last expansion. This gives the new quests a lot of great, unique moments. Want to control a flying dragon and dogfight with other dragons? Want to assault a lumber mill and take it away from an opposing faction? Want to drive a steam tank, launching ice bolts at zombies while you attempt to deploy gnome saboteurs to destroy enemy plague wagons? Wrath offers all of this with the usual goofy, over-the-top style that has become the series' trademark. These unique, scripted quests provide a pleasant variety for players who are tired of the all-too-typical kill-and-gather quests. That's not to say that the game still doesn't make you grind, but getting one or two of these more-interesting quests each night feels like a nice reward after killing those 15 plagued spiders that took you 30 minutes to find.</div><div><div><br/><div>The new dungeons also seem to have been designed with accessibility in mind, with shorter lengths in lots of the leveling instances. In these new areas, it's not uncommon to blaze through a five-man dungeon in under 30 minutes. That may not sound like a good thing, initially, but since it lets you see the more-interesting boss fights more frequently, it's actually a very good thing. Late-game raids in Wrath can be run in 10- or 25-player mode. This is cool because it lets players who might not be in a large, organized guild still have a chance at seeing some content that they might not be able to see otherwise. Both versions offer the same content, but the 25-man version offers slightly better loot. This change is great for casual players while still giving the hardcore guilds an incentive by making the top-tier loot exclusively available to the players who are organized enough to play with 25-man groups.</div><br/><div>Player-versus-player combat is still a major part of World of Warcraft in this expansion. Players have new abilities to access in PVP battles, and Wrath adds an additional multiplayer battleground called Strand of the Agents. Strand puts one team on offense and the other on defense and opens with the offensive team making a Normandy-style beach landing, followed by an attack on the town gates of a city that the defenders must keep safe. Players can drive battering ram vehicles to knock down walls, but must also be careful of artillery mounted on the city walls. After the offense captures the city or time runs out, the factions swap sides.</div><br/><div> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3246/181547-ss17.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181547" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.72285714285714" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:72.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3246/181547-ss17.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181547"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3246/181547-ss17.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3246/181547-ss17.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Northrend is full of well-designed new areas and things to do.</figcaption></figure>Wrath also adds two new arenas to Warcraft's competitive Arena system, where groups of 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 matches occur. The <a data-ref-id="3035-74" href="/orgrimmar/3035-74" slug="orgrimmar">Orgrimmar</a> Arena is designed like a Roman colosseum where teams enter on a platform underground and are raised up to the floor when the match starts. It has moving pillars that can interrupt ranged attacks. Walls of fire erupt from the ground, causing damage to players standing nearby. The <a data-ref-id="3035-131" href="/dalaran/3035-131" slug="dalaran">Dalaran</a> arena takes place in the sewers of Dalaran with players starting in pipes and being pushed out by a stream of water when the match starts. The first arena season for Wrath of the Lich King starts December 13th, a month after the initial release of the expansion. Right now, PvP is a little random, since many players are still coming to grips with the new abilities.</div><br/><div>While what's in the box and on the servers is great, it's not quite as much as was originally promised for the expansion. Several raids, including an epic battle with Arthas himself, aren't available at the time of this writing, and are scheduled to appear in an upcoming content patch. Also, promised features like dual specs, which will allow players to flip between two sets of talent configurations on the fly, haven't made it in yet.</div><br/><div>But it's hard to complain too much about minor omissions like those when the current content in Wrath of the Lich King is so broad and so solid. This package makes for an epic and excellent expansion to World of Warcraft, one that will certainly keep longtime players coming back. And the increased accessibility and streamlined nature of World of Warcraft 2008 compared to World of Warcraft 2004 mean that even players who gave up a long time ago will also find plenty of reasons to return to Azeroth.</div></div></div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20701/]]></api_detail_url><id>20701</id><name><![CDATA[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/3030-20701/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-21 17:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-78025/]]></api_detail_url><id>78025</id><name><![CDATA[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Andy]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king-review/1900-88/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Mac, PC]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-89/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Skate It offers three different control schemes, but none of them save the game from its long list of issues.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/809527-skitwi005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-809527" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/809527-skitwi005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-809527"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/809527-skitwi005.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The ghostly streets of San Vanelona mean you won't have to deal with cops this time.</figcaption></figure>The biggest problem I had with EA's Skate was that the trick system was a bit too complex to fit into the game's control scheme. It's great to have a ton of available tricks, but with a system that requires you to move the right analog <em>just so</em> to do a specific trick, and a series of challenges that demand that you do very specific tricks to proceed, the fun of the early game quickly turned to frustration. If you want to imagine how the Wii-based not-quite-a-sequel, Skate It, fares, just imagine the frustration that comes when you expect precision from a Wii Remote. Nope. Doesn't work. Mercifully, a lot of the game doesn't demand so much specificity that you can't just sort of lamely wave your arm at the TV and succeed on some level.</div><br/><div>Skate It serves as a mid-point between the original game and the 2009 sequel, Skate 2. It seems that San Vanelona, the fictional city that serves as the backdrop for the original game, has been hit by a grip of unspecified disasters. This gives you a completely abandoned city to skate in. It also gives a bit of a story-justified reason for the ghost town feel of the entire game, which probably has a lot more to do with the limitations of the Wii than any sort of simple story stuff. Of course, you actually leave San Vanelona in Skate It, and there's no explanation for why cities like Paris or London don't have any people or cars on the streets. The barren nature of the world makes the game feel really dated, like it was some kind of PS1 port of a PS2 Tony Hawk game.</div><br/><div>The control options are probably the most important thing about Skate It. You can choose from three different schemes. The most basic is a Remote-only scheme. You steer by tilting the Remote, and tricks are also governed by how you move the Remote. So if you tilt sideways and lift up, that's supposed to do a kickflip or heelflip. Circular motions, half-circles, and so on let you bust out the other tricks in the Skate It repertoire. In most cases, downward motions instead of upwards motions are supposed to let you do nollie versions of most of your tricks.</div><br/><div>If you hook up a Nunchuk, you can move steering off of the Remote and over to the analog stick, which is better. Still, it doesn't really solve the core problem--getting the Wii Remote to translate your motions into the tricks you're attempting to perform at the precise time you're trying to perform them. Even busting out simple ollies with precise timing seems like random chance due to the temperamental nature of the hardware. You're left with the feeling that the developer tried to fit too many different motions onto the Remote. I found that the circular motions were much better about coming out on demand, so I found myself flipping into and out of just about anything I did.</div><br/><div>The third control scheme uses the Remote and the Balance Board. Things like steering and manuals feel really natural with the board, but in this mode, you have to use the D pad on the Remote to toggle your way through multiple sets of tricks, then put pressure on specific sections of the board to perform them. While the steering and movement might work just fine for players who just want to skate around the world and do whatever, it doesn't really make for a very fun experience if you're trying to actually progress through the game's career mode.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/809514-skitwi019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-809514" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/809514-skitwi019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-809514"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/809514-skitwi019.jpg"/></a><figcaption>You may recognize some of the spots from the first game.</figcaption></figure>The career is structured in the classic skateboarding game style. You're nobody, and you want to sell out as quickly as possible to be the biggest skater in the world. So you're constantly doing tricks that are photographed and filmed to get in skate magazines, then you get the honor of choosing which sponsors to align your virtual self with, and so on and so forth. Along the way you'll bump into a collection of professional skaters, who do a really good job of not sounding like professional voice actors.</div><br/><div>The bulk of the game's voice comes from <span><a data-ref-id="3005-8773" href="/giovanni-reda/3005-8773" slug="giovanni-reda">Giovanni Reda</a></span>, the same professional skateboarding photographer and video guy who commentated the first game. Reda comes across as super-repetitive and obnoxious in Skate It. Also, you don't seem him skating around behind you or anything. It's like his voice is just in your head or something.</div><br/><div>The developers probably really wanted to make sure that the animation in Skate It looked right. That's probably the best part about the way it looks--the tricks animate well and the skating generally looks realistic. But the rest of the game, from the player models to the textures, to the environments, just look kind of bad. Given that it's a Wii release, it's impossible to expect the Skate experience to move from 360/PS3 to the Wii with no compromises, but man... parts of this game are just downright ugly.</div><br/><div>As with the original Skate, Skate It manages to feel authentic and it comes with some sharp ideas. But the game's presentation and control just don't pan out, and it seems like a game that'll frustrate players more often than not. If you're a Skate fan looking for what's next, do yourself a solid and wait for <a data-ref-id="3030-20661" href="/skate-2/3030-20661" slug="skate-2">Skate 2</a>.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21495/]]></api_detail_url><id>21495</id><name><![CDATA[Skate It]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/skate-it/3030-21495/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-26 13:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-79494/]]></api_detail_url><id>79494</id><name><![CDATA[Skate It]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/skate-it-review/1900-89/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-90/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is a top-notch redesign that makes intelligent changes to the gameplay and balance while also offering a perfectly viable online experience.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/498/235273-cvbgfh.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-235273" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/498/235273-cvbgfh.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-235273"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/498/235273-cvbgfh.jpeg"/></a><figcaption>The classic struggle of speed vs. power rages on.</figcaption></figure>Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is probably a game that Capcom should have made a long time ago. Or, at least, the mentality behind this game should have been employed long before this point. With a series of intelligent updates and a real attention to detail, it feels like HD Remix was done by a group of people who understand the source material and treat it with an appropriate amount of reverence. The end result is a game that raises the bar for modern remakes and updates of classic games.</div><br/><div>HD Remix is, as the name implies, an updated version of <span><a data-ref-id="3030-1251" href="/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo/3030-1251" slug="super-street-fighter-ii-turbo">Super Street Fighter II Turbo</a></span>. Super Turbo was the last in the Street Fighter II line, and it's a game that built upon (and repaired) a lot of the changes made in the previous game, <a data-ref-id="3030-6665" href="/super-street-fighter-ii/3030-6665" slug="super-street-fighter-ii">Super Street Fighter II</a>. Super and Super Turbo essentially rebuilt the Street Fighter II experience with new moves, new characters, and newer, more powerful hardware underneath the hood. Some of the changes were positive, but there was definitely a downside, too. A new announcer and a lot of new character voices appeared here, and some of them were downright awful. Also, the CPU opponent got way more difficult, to the point where you could only really enjoy the game if you were playing with a similarly skilled human opponent. On top of all that, the Street Fighter II series had already been around for three years by the time Super Turbo was released. I don't know what you were doing in 1994, but I was sort of done with Street Fighter II and getting into other fighting games, so I never really gave Super Turbo much thought.</div><br/><div>OK, that's probably a bit more history than you actually require. The key thing to know is that HD Remix rebuilds and rebalances Super Turbo, and the changes all feel intelligently designed. The look of the game has been completely overhauled by the comic book artists at Udon, resulting in crisper, better-looking characters and backgrounds. You've never see a chicken get choked so clearly until you've seen the updated version of <a data-ref-id="3005-267" href="/chun-li/3005-267" slug="chun-li">Chun-Li</a>'s stage. The dude getting drunk in the background of <a data-ref-id="3005-6" href="/zangief/3005-6" slug="zangief">Zangief</a>'s level has never looked better. Of course, the fighters themselves have also been redone. For the most part, they look great. The animation, however, throws the whole thing off a little bit. In order to keep the game running like it should with the same timing that players are used to, the developers didn't add a bunch of new frames of animation to the game. The result is that you see characters who should move really smoothly, like a <a data-ref-id="3025-287" href="/guilty-gear/3025-287" slug="guilty-gear">Guilty Gear</a> game or something. Instead, they animate just like they did back in 1994. This is, actually, the right move. Smoothing things out would ruin the gameplay. But it still looks a little odd in spots. If the new character art really bothers you, you can disable it to go back to the original sprites. You can also disable the default 16:9 view and take it back to the original 4:3 design. But there's no option to restore the original background art.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/498/235345-gfhfj.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-235345" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/498/235345-gfhfj.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-235345"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/498/235345-gfhfj.jpeg"/></a><figcaption>Even Akuma seems to play fair this time.</figcaption></figure>The audio has also been carefully overhauled. In places where it made sense to keep the original Super Turbo voices, they've been kept. In cases where the Super Turbo audio was terrible--like the stupid announcer or <a data-ref-id="3005-266" href="/guile/3005-266" slug="guile">Guile</a>'s voice--that speech has been replaced. This actually fixes my top complaint with the original games. Guile now says "sonic boom" the same way he did in the older Street Fighter II games. And the announcer sounds like a new recording of a guy doing everything he can to sound like the old Street Fighter II announcer, not the guy from Super. It's all in the way he says "<em>sevennnn</em>!" All of the music has been remixed, too. The new music is pretty good, mixing up some of the styles of the source material to form tracks that sound enough like the old music to get by. If you like, you can disable the new music and return to the versions from the original Super Turbo. The voices won't revert back to the originals, but since they constitute an improvement across the board, that's not a big deal.</div><br/><div>While the most obvious changes to HD Remix are purely audiovisual in nature, there has also been a lot of work done to the characters themselves, the way their moves behave, and even the way some of them are performed. This was done in an effort to rebalance the game and make more characters viable in top-level, tournament play. If you're not already up on things like how many frames it takes for Sagat to recover from a tiger shot, or the properties of <a data-ref-id="3005-212" href="/ken-masters/3005-212" slug="ken-masters">Ken</a>'s dragon punch, you probably won't notice most of the changes. Some of them are far less subtle. Honda's jab torpedo can now travel through and destroy projectiles, giving him another way to close the gap between him and his opponent. <a data-ref-id="3005-103" href="/ryu/3005-103" slug="ryu">Ryu</a> can now do a fake fireball, which may entice your opponent to jump in. Moves that required three button presses can now be done with two to help make the game easier on a gamepad. While you might not notice all of the changes, the outcome is a great game that feels more balanced and more entertaining from top to bottom. That's something that players of all skill levels can appreciate. It's what Super Turbo should have been all along.</div><br/><div>Of course, all of this would be for naught if the online side of the game didn't work. So the best part about the game is that the online has the ability to work incredibly well. I'm playing with a fairly standard DSL connection at home, and most of my matches felt perfect. Of course, you'll always run into some laggards from time to time, and in high-ping matches, the game acts completely crazy. You're better off using the custom match option to find games, which lets you see a player's ping before joining up. I routinely encountered ping times under 100, and occasionally as low as 30. These matches felt A-OK.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/810006-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-810006" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5125786163522" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:51.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/810006-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-810006"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/810006-8.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/810006-8.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Super Combo Finish!</figcaption></figure>In addition to the basic ranked match, you can also get a group together for unranked matches. There's also a tournament option that lets up to eight players collide in a bracketed tournament, though you don't actually get to watch any of the other matches in the tournament. There are also some other smart but minor things in play here, like the way the game doesn't show you what character your opponent is picking ahead of time. This prevents players from trying to create specific, advantageous match-ups by waiting for the other player to choose a fighter.</div><br/><div>In recent history, re-releases of old arcade games has been a trend, but it's also been a real non-event. Most of these games received a quick coat of fresh paint, which usually made the game look worse. Things like online play are only included in their basest, most simplified form. HD Remix makes most of those older releases look like cheap cash-ins. It may cost more than most arcade updates available for consoles today, but with the number of important changes being made and its extreme attention to detail, Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix sets a new standard for downloadable arcade games... even though I still think Blanka's face doesn't look quite right.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20616/]]></api_detail_url><id>20616</id><name><![CDATA[Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo-hd-remix/3030-20616/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-11-30 14:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-79235/]]></api_detail_url><id>79235</id><name><![CDATA[Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>5</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo-hd-remix-review/1900-90/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3), Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-91/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Grave performance issues, a bland narrative, and a condescending level of difficulty burn through most of Need for Speed Undercover's potential for fun.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/591411-nfsucfmv1ms6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-591411" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:50.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/591411-nfsucfmv1ms6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-591411"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4938/591411-nfsucfmv1ms6.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The cutscenes are all style, no substance.</figcaption></figure>“You're not good, and you're not bad.” This is one of the lines that pops up repeatedly during loading screens in Need for Speed Undercover. It's a phrase designed to flatly establish the coolly antiheroic nature of your role as a street-racing undercover cop, though there's no such grey area when it comes to the actual quality of Undercover. After last year's <a data-ref-id="3030-18095" href="/need-for-speed-prostreet/3030-18095" slug="need-for-speed-prostreet">Need for Speed: ProStreet</a>, an oddly street-less street-racer, I saw some good potential in <a data-ref-id="3025-483" href="/need-for-speed/3025-483" slug="need-for-speed">Need for Speed</a>'s return to the heady blend of cops-n-robbers gameplay and goofy live-action cutscenes that made <a data-ref-id="3030-12976" href="/need-for-speed-most-wanted/3030-12976" slug="need-for-speed-most-wanted">Most Wanted</a> such intense and intensely silly fun. But execution is nine-tenths of the law, and Undercover feels careless and mercenary, lacking the enthusiastic verve that made Most Wanted more than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>You play Undercover as a <a data-ref-id="3015-54" href="/silent-protagonist/3015-54" slug="silent-protagonist">silent protagonist</a> who, with the help of a chilly FBI handler played by <span>Maggie Q</span>, is plunged into the world of criminal street racing gangs, with the hopes of finding, uh, something. Or maybe a guy. I think the guy has a thing, or some stuff, and you're trying to get it back. Your motives for risking life and limb to infiltrate and then take down these gangs of tough-talking male models are muddled, but then, so is most of the plot. The disjointed live-action cutscenes are all slickly produced and filled with pretty people, but they rarely mean anything, and half of them involve an especially wooden Maggie Q delivering serious-sounding cop-talk to an empty room. With a few rare exceptions, everyone else comes off as disaffected and/or bland, with only a few fleeting moments of hammy overacting to lighten the mood. It's all bad nonsense, but not nearly bad enough to be good again.<br/><br/>In between the bloodless cutscenes, you'll race on the streets of the Tri-City Bay Area, a trio of small, caricatured cities linked by highways and causeways that reminded me of Florida, or at least Florida as it is portrayed in something like <em>CSI: Miami </em>or <em>Miami Vice</em>. The layout isn't anything special, but the geography is a healthy mix of dense urban areas and winding back country roads, though there were a few turns that seemed like they were pulled straight out of previous Need for Speed games. What gives the game much of its personality is the way it piles on the special effects, giving the game a hazy, dusky look with orange and black hues that really pop. There are some rough spots, such as the game's rather smudgy sky box, and the alarming speed with which the sun will sometimes streak across the sky, but the real killer is the frame rate. It constantly chugs and sputters, regularly turning into a slide show, and it only gets worse as the cars get faster. It destroy the game's sense of speed, and it interferes with the gameplay so thoroughly that it makes Undercover's other problems harder to forgive.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/585117-aq_master_000019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-585117" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/585117-aq_master_000019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-585117"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/585117-aq_master_000019.jpg"/></a><figcaption>This should actually give you a pretty good sense of the game's frame rate.</figcaption></figure>The format is nearly identical to what Most Wanted and Carbon featured, offering up straight street races against AI opponents, checkpoint races, and missions that force you to rack up property damage and outrun the cops. The big new race type is the highway battle, which is effectively a flat and straight version of the drift battles from Carbon. You and another racer go head-to-head on the game's sprawling highway system, with the objective of pulling ahead of your opponent by a certain distance. Weaving in and out of traffic can be intermittently thrilling, though the ease in which you can trip up your opponents by nudging a few civilian cars can make these events pretty short. The different race types provide you with a decent amount of variety, and while the licensed cars you can drive generally don't feel like they've got much weight, they also feel slippery in a good, action-movie kind of way. What sucks a lot of the fun out of Undercover is that it's way too easy. The race AI can be shamelessly rubber-bandy, and it gives up halfway through many races. The cops are similarly uncommitted, and I often found that, even when I was allotted three or four minutes to lose the cops, it took little effort to do it in less than one. Aside from the police pursuits, the game doesn't make very good use of the open world format, especially since you can select any available missions from the in-game map. <br/><br/>This brings up the game's often arbitrary domination system, which rewards you for winning events in a certain amount of time. You'd think the domination bonus would be based on how thoroughly you trounce your competition, but it rarely seems like it's reflective of your actual performance. There were races where I blew away the competition by a good ten seconds and didn't get the domination bonus, and others where I just barely scraped ahead, but was rewarded for it. Another minor point in Undercover that really got under my skin was how blatant it was about pushing EA's filthy downloadable content agenda. Playing the Xbox 360 version, every time I tried and purchase cars or upgrades, the game asked if I wanted to use in-game money (which it confusingly refers to as “cash”) or Microsoft Points (which are actually cash) to pay for them. All told, you could easily spend as much money on in-game items as the game itself costs, which is especially pointless since it doesn't take much effort to earn it honestly. <br/><br/>I'll admit that my fondness for Need for Speed Most Wanted colored my expectations for Need for Speed Undercover, but this game's general failure as a racing game ends up being so significant that its inability to recapture the fun of Most Wanted in particular is kind of a moot point. There's no shortage of street racing games on the market right now, and there's simply no room for a game that can't nail down some of the basics.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20741/]]></api_detail_url><id>20741</id><name><![CDATA[Need for Speed: Undercover]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/need-for-speed-undercover/3030-20741/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-12-01 21:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73526/]]></api_detail_url><id>73526</id><name><![CDATA[Need for Speed: Undercover]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/need-for-speed-undercover-review/1900-91/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-92/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[The core of You're In The Movies is sound, but technology woes and a reliance on repetition really get in the way of the fun.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/311009-yitm_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-311009" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/311009-yitm_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-311009"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/311009-yitm_01.jpg"/></a><figcaption>No one will be admitted during the shocking HULA HOOPING scene!</figcaption></figure>You're In The Movies is a clever concept, but its appeal is fleeting. Using your Xbox Live Vision camera to create goofy little movie trailers that the game assembles via a series of camera-based minigames ended up being fun around three times. Once I had made three trailers, I realized that the only way I'd ever have lasting fun with You're In The Movies was to keep introducing it to new people and having some vicarious fun through them. Or I could start playing it naked. With four-player support, nude play might make for an interesting time, but even the most inventive nudists could probably get by with a mere rental.</div><br/><div>The concept is simple, but effective. You and up to three players participate in a series of minigames that have you pointing, swatting at on-screen objects, pretending to run, and other big motions. They're all played with the Xbox Live Vision camera, so you'll see yourself on the monitor, swatting and gesticulating away. You'll also be asked to emote in various ways in a non-game setting so the game can capture you laughing, looking confused, and so on. Then all of these recorded clips are compiled and shoved into a brief movie trailer, as if you and your three friends are (wait for it) <em>in the movies</em>.</div><br/><div>The game comes with 30 such clips, most of which are locked when you first get the game up and running. You'll also earn the ability to cobble together your own pieces. The film you choose to make at the beginning, of course, dictates which minigames you'll play, which expressions you'll be asked to make, and so on. The different trailers are nicely ridiculous and play off of movie trailer stereotypes pretty well, including obvious-but-solid bits like the 50s monster movie that features a large, superimposed lizard on-screen as the "monster." You'll find a smattering of different genres throughout, and though none is available as of this writing, the game appears to have hooks in it for downloadable additions.</div><br/><div>With 30 flicks to choose from, there's kind of a lot of content to create, but there aren't enough minigames to keep you hooked from start to finish. So the act of creating a trailer, which takes around 20 minutes for four players to complete, gets repetitive quickly. Of course, if you want to invent your own fun, there's more to be had by totally ignoring the annoying director's instructions. Deadpanning during shots where you're supposed to act outrageous ended up being one of my favorites, and there's always the ol' "give the camera the middle finger" trick. Any of these make the resulting trailer weirder and a little more fun to watch because it gives the whole thing a <em>Mad Libs</em> feel, where you just act how you want and see it all come together in ways that make zero sense. As "pretending" to be an ass is my specialty, ignoring the game's orders is how I had most of my fun with the game.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/311014-yitm_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-311014" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/311014-yitm_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-311014"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/311014-yitm_06.jpg"/></a><figcaption>This guy wore a hat! What a maniac!</figcaption></figure>Unfortunately, a lot of the fun things about You're In The Movies come crashing down due to the extremely temperamental nature of the technology at work. The game first asks to take a picture of your empty background. Then, remembering what it looks like when empty, the game attempts to find you and cut you out, making sure that you can appear on screen while removing everything behind you. It's very particular, then, about making sure that nothing changes in that background. If the lighting changes, or if you bump the camera, the whole thing is totally boned. On top of that, getting it to properly recognize you and cut you out from the background properly feels like a real chore. I've had success with other camera games at home in the past, but this one is harder to get working than anything I've used in the past. Even on the pro-grade green screen in our studio--which is made for this exact sort of thing--the cut-out didn't look so great. So if you play games in a room with challenging lighting or a cluttered backdrop that you're not willing to clear out, you'll probably never get it quite right. Again, if you subscribe to the whole "worse is better" theory of comedy, recording movies with missing stomachs and heads can be kind of funny.</div><br/><div>Annoyingly, there doesn't seem to be a game-only version of You're In The Movies. It's only available as a package with the camera for $69.99. If you already have a camera, you're faced with either buying another one or hunting used bins for a separate copy. If you're already in the market for a camera, the bundle is a bit more attractive, but even if you consider the game to be the discounted item instead of the camera, you're still paying too much.</div><br/><div>There are neat ideas at work, but ultimately, the premise and structure of You're In The Movies is a little too thin to recommend. If you're going to be getting a rowdy group together, and you're patient enough to get the camera working, it can make for a fun evening or two. But the thrills don't last.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21168/]]></api_detail_url><id>21168</id><name><![CDATA[You're In the Movies]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/youre-in-the-movies/3030-21168/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-12-02 21:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-78033/]]></api_detail_url><id>78033</id><name><![CDATA[You're In the Movies ]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/youre-in-the-movies-review/1900-92/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-93/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[SmackDown! vs. RAW 2009 has a lengthy list of features and modes, but none of them truly capture the excitement of watching WWE on television.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8875/206223-smackdown_vs_raw_2009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-206223" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56237424547284" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8875/206223-smackdown_vs_raw_2009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-206223"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8875/206223-smackdown_vs_raw_2009.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Nothing settles your differences quite like fighting in a burning ring.</figcaption></figure>Professional wrestling might not be for everyone, but it's hard to argue against the level of passion and excitement generated by its fans and participants alike. By employing a careful balance of theatrics and athleticism, pro wrestling at its best can be engaging and really fun to watch. But when that balance gets off-kilter, the whole thing heads south in a hurry. While the <a data-ref-id="3025-130" href="/wwe/3025-130" slug="wwe">WWE</a> has been hit and miss lately on television and pay-per-view, the televised spectacle is still worlds more entertaining than its video game counterparts. THQ's latest installment in the WWE SmackDown! series builds on last year's game in ways that fans of the series will probably appreciate, but it fails to capture most of the thrill of the real deal.</div><br/><div>Most of the blame for the game's lifeless vibe falls on audio and the animation. The game's speech is completely flat, and it all sounds like it was recorded in some quiet sound studio, not in some arena full of screaming fans. Without any of the live arena energy flowing, the wrestlers and announcers alike turn in sleepy performances that sound like they're reading from a script and can't wait to be finished. The deliberate pacing and pauses for shouts, boos, or applause that you hear from wrestlers on television aren't present, and the announcers are repetitive and often non-specific. Actual wrestling commentary goes all over the place, talking about the match at hand, the dramatic events that led to the current confrontation, upcoming matches appearing later on the show, and, if you're lucky, barbecue sauce. SmackDown! 2009 attempts to cover these bases in fits and starts, but it usually boils down to <a data-ref-id="3040-59816" href="/jerry-lawler/3040-59816" slug="jerry-lawler">Jerry "The King" Lawler</a> "oh, did you see that?" followed immediately by <a data-ref-id="3040-89857" href="/jim-ross/3040-89857" slug="jim-ross">Jim Ross</a> with "he dropped... the elbow!" Maybe I'm just elbow-crazy, but it seemed like I was hearing that exact exchange four or five times per match.</div><br/><div>The character models in SmackDown! look really sharp and, at times, lifelike... at least when they're standing still. In motion, the game becomes a series of triggered animations that don't transition very well, so you'll stutter around the ring in a weird manner, then trigger a move that takes the control out of your hands for three seconds or so while your wrestler delivers a suplex, chains together a few punches, or argues with the referee over a slow count. Those canned animations look nice, but they just make you wish that the rest of the game looked that good while you were actually in control. It's also worth pointing out that the game has a fair amount of full-motion video in it for entrances and setups for the story modes. Most of it is the same slick, well-edited stuff that the WWE uses on television, but it's so blocky and artifact-filled that it looks like an old Saturn game or something. This is especially weak in the PS3 version, considering there's probably plenty of space on the Blu-Ray disc for better in-game video compression.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9726/333159-945632_20080329_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-333159" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9726/333159-945632_20080329_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-333159"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9726/333159-945632_20080329_screen004.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Anything's legal when the ref's back is turned.</figcaption></figure>Actually controlling the action in WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2009 (featuring ECW!) will be a snap if you've stuck with the series as it's developed. If you've skipped a few, though, you'll probably find things to be pretty arcane, especially in some of the more-specific match types. The game offers page after page of control notes in the pause menu, and it will occasionally pause here and there to tell you about the controls for getting out of the ring, tagging a partner, or other new concepts when they first pop up. But it still isn't always clear how to put your opponent onto (or through) a table, and getting in the right position to pick up weapons also seems more mysterious than it should be. The game attempts to focus more on tag team wrestling this year, which is strange when you consider how meaningless tag teams have become in the WWE. Regardless, this leads to a new "hot tag" mechanic that lets the man on the apron build up strength and burst into the ring to execute a quick time event that leaves both opponents on the mat and his momentum meter filled and prepped for a finisher. Overall, the gameplay still doesn't do much to make you feel like you're participating in an actual WWE match. It just feels like a bad fighting game.</div><br/><div>It took me a couple of hours to get the hang of things and start really tearing apart the AI competitors, but I didn't feel like any of that was preparing me to face human opposition. Online or with local compadres, the game becomes more about properly timing reversal attempts and knowing your opponent's range and recovery time. Filtered though a haze of network-induced latency, timing your movements becomes pretty frustrating. While I normally get very low pings in online games, the on-screen meters in both the PS3 and 360 versions of SmackDown! showed all my opposition as having the worst possible network conditions. So either the only people playing SmackDown! are doing so in faraway foreign lands, or there's something up with the network code.</div><br/><div>The different modes and features of SmackDown! dress up the basic wrestling action in a number of different ways. You can go in and string together different animations to form your own finishing moves. You can piece together your own wrestlers out of a collection of clothing, body types, sliders, and move sets. You can get online and view, rate, and share screenshots or video clips, which is great if you want to see upskirts of the game's female roster.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9775/246239-www_smackdown_vs_raw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-246239" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.6" data-width="430" style="width: 430px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9775/246239-www_smackdown_vs_raw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-246239"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9775/246239-www_smackdown_vs_raw.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9775/246239-www_smackdown_vs_raw.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Deadman choking.</figcaption></figure>You can also engage in a lengthy, but generic career mode, or play a more focused "Road to Wrestlemania" mode that attempts to inject some storyline stuff into the proceedings. But this option is only available for <a data-ref-id="3005-469" href="/triple-h/3005-469" slug="triple-h">Triple H</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-614" href="/cm-punk/3005-614" slug="cm-punk">CM Punk</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-470" href="/john-cena/3005-470" slug="john-cena">John Cena</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-473" href="/the-undertaker/3005-473" slug="the-undertaker">The Undertaker</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-562" href="/chris-jericho/3005-562" slug="chris-jericho">Chris Jericho</a>, or a tag team storyline with <a data-ref-id="3005-587" href="/rey-mysterio/3005-587" slug="rey-mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-589" href="/batista/3005-589" slug="batista">Batista</a>. Road to Wrestlemania is probably the best thing about the entire game, since it most closely resembles what you see on TV. CM Punk's story takes him through a set of struggles to capture and retain the ECW championship by fighting off the likes of <a data-ref-id="3005-616" href="/elijah-burke/3005-616" slug="elijah-burke">Elijah Burke</a> while also dealing with roadblocks put up by <span>Stephanie McMahon</span> and Tazz. John Cena's story opens at the Tribute to the Troops show and has him defending American pride against opponents like MVP, Umaga, and William Regal. Triple H's story branches to allow for him to reform the old Evolution stable or re-team with <a data-ref-id="3005-597" href="/shawn-michaels/3005-597" slug="shawn-michaels">Shawn Michaels</a> to reform D-Generation X yet again. As you move from week to week in this mode, the announcers are also given more specific things to say about your situation. It all comes together much better here than it does in any other part of the game.</div><br/><div>Over the years, the list of match types available in SmackDown! has become absolutely out of control. At this point, the differences between the different types feels smaller and smaller, with things like regular tag team matches, tornado tag matches, ladder tornado tag matches, table tornado tag matches, and so on. But the big, marquee match types you'd want to see, like tables, ladders, and chairs matches, the Money in the Bank match, cage matches, Elimination Chamber matches, and the Royal Rumble are all present.</div><br/><div>I won't deny that there are some people out there who will be able to completely ignore everything that stuck out to me about SmackDown! 2009 and have a great time creating wrestlers that look like other wrestlers and editing together crazy highlight reel clips. But to me, the entire game feels lifeless and old. The presentation fails to capture the excitement of the real thing. The gameplay doesn't match the product it's attempting to emulate. And the layers upon layers of plain-looking menus feel like they were ripped out of a PlayStation 2 launch game. Something as dynamic and as ridiculously over-the-top as the real-life WWE deserves better.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20680/]]></api_detail_url><id>20680</id><name><![CDATA[WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2009]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2009/3030-20680/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-12-07 12:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73205/]]></api_detail_url><id>73205</id><name><![CDATA[WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2009]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>2</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2009-review/1900-93/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360, PlayStation 3]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-94/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Stunning presentation and an engaging open-world reprisal of the series' trademark platforming action make this newly reimagined Prince of Persia easy to recommend.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2179/181795-pop4__1_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181795" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2179/181795-pop4__1_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181795"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2179/181795-pop4__1_.jpg"/></a><figcaption>New prince, new quest. Same gymnastics.</figcaption></figure>It's only been five years since Ubisoft successfully brought <a data-ref-id="3040-2643" href="/jordan-mechner/3040-2643" slug="jordan-mechner"> Jordan Mechner</a>'s old PC action series <a data-ref-id="3030-2561" href="/prince-of-persia/3030-2561" slug="prince-of-persia"> Prince of Persia</a> into 3D, and now it's already gone and reinvented the franchise for a second time. The newest <a data-ref-id="3030-20961" href="/prince-of-persia/3030-20961" slug="prince-of-persia"> Prince of Persia</a>--presumably lacking a subtitle to set it apart from the previous three games--imagines an even more fantastic Arabian-tinged setting than what you've seen in this franchise before, and it's filled with an entertaining story and plenty of high-flying excitement. The series' trademark gravity-defying platforming has gotten so mechanically complex that it comes off as a little, well, mechanical at times, but the level variety, fantastic presentation and atmospheric soundtrack make this an engaging adventure well worth embarking on.<br/><br/>There's no connection whatsoever to the last Prince of Persia trilogy; this one starts fresh with an entirely different prince. Actually, he doesn't appear to be much a prince at all, but more of a roguish, tomb-raiding vagabond, a <a data-ref-id="3005-3260" href="/han-solo/3005-3260" slug="han-solo"> Han Solo</a> of the desert who's in it for wealth and glory but hardly for honor. Too bad for him, he gets caught up with <a data-ref-id="3005-1024" href="/elika/3005-1024" slug="elika"> Elika</a>, a do-gooding princess with magical powers who's bent on restoring beauty to her corrupted kingdom and cramming the culprit, the dark god  Ahriman, back into his eternal prison. The story takes some unexpected turns here and there, and gets surprisingly poignant as it goes, culminating in an ending I didn't quite see coming. Naturally, there's a good setup for a sequel.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2179/181895-pop4__14_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181895" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2179/181895-pop4__14_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181895"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2179/181895-pop4__14_.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Chances are, you're familiar with this particular action.</figcaption></figure> There aren't a lot of heavy-handed cutscenes foisted on you throughout the game. You get the important beats of the story in the few mandatory cinematics, but I liked that the majority of the dialog is optional. You can hit a talk button anywhere in between action sequences to have a quick chat with Elika. Sometimes the pair discusses the often rich history of the current level. Sometimes Elika talks about her devotion to the benevolent god Ormazd. Sometimes they flirt. Maybe it was <em>because</em> the dialog wasn't forced on me that I wanted to hear more of it from time to time; in any case, the brief exchanges were a clever and effective way to flesh out the game's back story and give the lead characters richer personalities. You get the sense that someone thought really hard about the game's world and its residents from these exchanges.<br/><br/>Of course, you get heaps and heaps of the wall-jumping, pole-climbing, superhuman gymnastics you'd expect from a Prince of Persia. This time around, you can add ring-swinging, roof-running, sliding, and even the occasional flight to your repertoire. These moves are all mixed up thoroughly enough that you have to stay on your toes to bust out the right move at the right time and avoid plummeting to your doom. There are enough different platforming mechanics here that the action stays varied, and certainly looks flashy enough.<br/><br/>But it's also easy as all heck. The game might as well present specific button prompts as you reach each handhold or wall-jump point; they're indicated right there in the level design anyway. If there's a horizontal scrape on the wall, you know you need to wall run there. If there's a ring, you hit one button to swing off of it. A pole jutting out of the ceiling, you hit a different button to dart across. It starts to feel a little like Platforming-By-Numbers after a few hours, but the prince looks so cool performing all these larger-than-life maneuvers that I never got totally bored with the traversal gameplay.<br/><br/>Even if the platforming was really tough in a demanding, skill-based way, you'd have no penalty and little frustration due to the game's wildly forgiving death mechanic. In short, you can't die. Every time you miss a jump, Elika teleports in with her fancy magical powers and delivers you back to the last solid ground you stood on. In combat, she pulls you back for a minute to rest while the enemy regains a little health. There's been all kinds of ballyhoo about this feature, and there's a psychological component at work for those people who say this makes the game too easy. There's still a failure mechanic here; it's just streamlined by really tight checkpoints and no load times in between failures. Otherwise the only difference is the lack of a specific "Game Over" screen.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/832067-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-832067" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/832067-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-832067"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10024/832067-20.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10024/832067-20.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The one-on-one fights are exciting and rewarding to play.</figcaption></figure>One thing about Prince of Persia that really impressed me is the non-linear, open-world format Ubisoft devised for this game as a departure from the linear, narrative-heavy A-to-B-to-C adventures of the past three installments. Here's how it works. Ahriman has four lieutenants, and each one lurks in a lair with five blighted action stages standing between you and a final showdown with that boss. Every time you finish one of the sickly levels, you "heal" it into a prettier, greener version, at which time it's populated by glowing collectibles called light seeds. Then you get to go back through the level and collect those seeds. All the levels are physically connected, and you get a decent amount of freedom to go through them in the order you want.<br/><br/>This openness also works against the game's flow, however. There are four powers you have to unlock for Elika by collecting multiple quotas of light seeds, and each of the action stages requires you to have one of those powers to enter it. You can't clear out any of the bosses' areas entirely without having at least two of the powers, so three times throughout the game I found myself having finished every available level but still needing dozens more light seeds to gain the next power and open up more levels. I spent more of the game backtracking to completed levels, hunting for more seeds to let me progress than I would have liked.<br/><br/>Like the platforming, the combat emphasizes style--but doesn't sacrifice substance for it. The battles sometimes look like glorified <a data-ref-id="3015-6" href="/quick-time-event/3015-6" slug="quick-time-event"> Quick Time Events</a>, especially with button prompts popping up here and there, but there's also a pretty robust combo system under the hood that lets you chain together sword attacks, grapples, acrobatic moves, and magical Elika attacks into really long, rewarding combos. There are infrequent, easy fodder enemies here and there, but the vast majority of the combat takes place against the four bosses: the hunter, the alchemist, the concubine, and the warrior. Each one pops up for a fight--and a dramatic exchange of dialogue--at least once in each of the levels within its domain, and they all have different fighting styles and back stories that really flesh out the sort of tragedies that led to their service of a dark god in the first place. You see and fight with them so much, the four enemies end up becoming pretty iconic by the time you actually face off with each one for the final time.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/803827-pop_screen6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-803827" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/803827-pop_screen6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-803827"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2891/803827-pop_screen6.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2891/803827-pop_screen6.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>This is a stunning game to see and hear.</figcaption></figure>The game looks and sounds incredible. It's got a colorful, painterly visual style that runs a wide gamut between the sickly, desaturated slate blues and pea greens of the corrupted action levels, and the much richer, warmer healed versions they turn into. Some of the bigger levels with their long draw distances and massive, fantastic castles and towers in the distance are really a sight to behold. The environments and character designs, especially those of the four bosses, are all distinctive and memorable. The game's soundtrack really stuck with me, too; I found parts of it running through my head frequently even when I wasn't playing the game. It's got a flair for the epic but can also be a little haunting at times. The voice work is always at least competent and sometimes really good (the warrior comes to mind). The voice actor who plays the prince also voices <a data-ref-id="3005-162" href="/nathan-drake/3005-162" slug="nathan-drake"> Nathan Drake</a> in <a data-ref-id="3030-13992" href="/uncharted-drakes-fortune/3030-13992" slug="uncharted-drakes-fortune"> Uncharted</a>, which is appropriate because they're both irreverent, live-in-the-moment kind of guys.<br/><br/>If Ubisoft really had to go and release a fourth Prince of Persia game in five years, I'm glad it turned out as good--and more importantly, as distinctive--as this one did. It offers the specific gameplay features that fans of the series will be looking for, while establishing a sequel-ripe new world and story arc that are every bit as engaging as those of the previous trilogy. The slightly uneven pacing and relative ease of the gameplay are minor nitpicks in the grand scheme of this engrossing, beautiful adventure.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20961/]]></api_detail_url><id>20961</id><name><![CDATA[Prince of Persia]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/prince-of-persia/3030-20961/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-12-10 22:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-77867/]]></api_detail_url><id>77867</id><name><![CDATA[Prince of Persia]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Brad]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/prince-of-persia-review/1900-94/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-95/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[It's too easy to cheat around Lips' poor vocal- and pitch-detecting technology, but if you're willing to look past that, Lips is a satisfying home karaoke game.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176612-lips_stills002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176612" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176612-lips_stills002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176612"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/176612-lips_stills002.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The music videos are cropped to fill widescreen displays.</figcaption></figure>Games like Lips help me out with a core problem that I have with karaoke. Have you ever seen the crowd of people that actually gathers at a karaoke night down at your local bar? Maybe it's just my local bars, but it seems to bring out a mix of shut-ins who usually can't be bothered to change out of their bathrobes, and delusional older women who think they're, you know, <em>singers</em>. Then there's the group of early-20s girls in the back who sort of giggle at the proceedings when they're not making out with each other in a sad-but-effective attempt to get attention.</div><br/><div>OK, perhaps I've said too much. Let's start over. As a karaoke game, Lips lets you bring karaoke home, away from the seedy crowds, so you and your friends can just sort of have a good time. While Lips certainly isn't the greatest karaoke-focused game ever released, it's got enough good features and options to make it a decent Xbox 360-only answer to Sony's massive SingStar series. But if you're looking for a challenging singing experience that acts as an accurate judge of your vocal abilities, you're going to be pretty disappointed.</div><br/><div>The game is seriously lax when it comes to rating your vocals. For the occasional rapping or pitchless noisemaking that some songs feature, the game gives you full credit as long as noise is being made into the microphone. When you're actually singing, the game checks for a pitch. But you can be pretty off the mark and still do just fine. What's more, blowing into the mic usually fools the game into thinking you're singing in key and gives you a vibrato bonus in the process. Obviously, sitting around and cheatin your way around a karaoke game is a pretty pathetic thing to do--unless you're into achievement points, in which case it's an <em>awesome</em> thing to do, and we also recommend you try holding the mics up to your TV speaker to just capture the vocals of the original song. The side effect of this is that the game lets you challenge other players online, and you'll never know for sure if they're singing fairly or not.</div><br/><div>Provided you can put those faults out of your mind and play the game as intended, Lips is decent at what it does. The game comes with 40 tracks that cover a good-sized range of times and genres. It also features <a data-ref-id="3005-8074" href="/avril-lavigne/3005-8074" slug="avril-lavigne">Avril Lavigne</a>'s song, "Complicated," which has to be some sort of record holder for the song that appears in the most karaoke games of all time in the history of the world. I swear, it's like everyone got together and signed a blood pact to bring this Canadian pop-rock madness to as many homes as possible. There's also an in-game store with a few songs to choose from, but, at this point anyway, it doesn't seem like Microsoft has a dedication to regular downloadable content the way most other big music games do these days.</div><br/><div>But you might not actually need to go out and buy any more music, because Lips lets you import music via the same options you have to play your own music in most other games. You can pull songs from portable devices, play them from your 360's hard drive, or even stream them over your local network. Of course, this isn't quite the same as playing the songs that were built for the game, since you won't get on-screen lyrics or music videos. The game will, however, attempt to judge your performance. But this is just kind of there for show, as it just gives you points as long as you're making noise into the mic. If you know a lot of the words to songs, this mode is a terrific addition. If you need the pitch guide and lyrics to sing anything, though, you'll find it sorely lacking.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176618-lips_stills008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176618" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176618-lips_stills008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176618"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/176618-lips_stills008.jpg"/></a><figcaption>You can control this virtual music video by waving the mic around.</figcaption></figure>There are a few different modes to choose from when singing, and some of these take advantage of the motion sensor found in the microphones, like a time bomb minigame where you need to turn over a glass of water to put out the fuse of a bomb by rotating the mic. And in songs, you'll need to strike poses and move the mic to activate a higher-scoring star power equivalent. The mics that come with the game are pretty nice. They're wireless, and feel weighted properly to let you easily flip them around in your hand. Also, they light up around the base and pulsate while you sing. The motion sensor is used well throughout, such as the jukebox mode, which just plays the game's music until you shake a mic to join in and sing. This is also how one-player games can become duets, short songs can be extended to full-length, and so on.</div><br/><div>Sony's PlayStation 3 take on the concept, <a data-ref-id="3025-351" href="/singstar/3025-351" slug="singstar">SingStar</a>, is a more mature and robust karaoke solution for home consoles, with more songs to choose from and better pitch-sensing technology. So if you're in the market for a singing game and platform isn't an issue, that's the clear way to go. But Lips is hardly a bad game, so if you're unable to go the Sony route, Microsoft's answer does most of what it needs to do to be successful.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21171/]]></api_detail_url><id>21171</id><name><![CDATA[Lips]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/lips/3030-21171/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-12-12 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-78032/]]></api_detail_url><id>78032</id><name><![CDATA[Lips]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/lips-review/1900-95/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-96/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Despite an actual inability to power-up forever, PowerUp Forever is a good, fun dual-joystick shooter.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19205/834668-945857_20081024_screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-834668" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19205/834668-945857_20081024_screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-834668"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19205/834668-945857_20081024_screen003.jpg"/></a><figcaption>The ripples and waves from your shots and movement have a relaxing effect.</figcaption></figure>If you're going to go and call your game "PowerUp Forever," you should probably make sure that you can actually, like, <em>power-up forever</em>. Namco's downloadable dual-joystick shooter adheres to the letter of the law, but not the spirit. It doesn't take long to max out all of your available upgrades, and at some point you just start getting a refilled special weapons meter over and over again. That's technically a power-up. But this is not what I signed on for.<br/></div><br/><div>I'm tempted to just stop there and proclaim the game a complete failure by screwing up its main concept. But PowerUp Forever is a cool-looking take on the genre that survives even when faced with the non-foreverness of its powerupitude. It's like someone sat down with <a data-ref-id="3030-15849" href="/flow/3030-15849" slug="flow">Flow</a> or the first stage of <a data-ref-id="3030-14139" href="/spore/3030-14139" slug="spore">Spore</a> and said "what if we made this an actual <em>game</em>?" So you're sort of traversing a smooth, liquid world where your movement and attacks swirl the colored liquid about, producing something trippy, but also something much more relaxed than, say, the color-cycling, candy-flipping shader madness of something like <a data-ref-id="3030-7271" href="/space-giraffe/3030-7271" slug="space-giraffe">Space Giraffe</a>. Against that background you'll find a number of different enemies, like circular drones, big worms that shoot bullets out of their sides, and other vaguely organic-looking creatures. The most important enemy creatures are the parasites--little space neon squids that are your primary target. By destroying enough of these parasites as they flutter around and grab onto larger enemies, you'll summon a guardian. The guardians look more like ships than creatures, much like your own craft. You'll engage them in a bullet-filled circle strafe to the death, and when you win, you'll get a power-up and grow larger. Then the cycle begins anew and you're back on the hunt for parasites.</div><br/><div>The way you grow every time you beat a guardian gives the game an evolution-themed feel to it. Large, dormant enemies that used to ignore you and serve as fuel tanks for parasites spring to life and begin fighting. Meanwhile, the old enemies get smaller and smaller until you can just run into them without taking damage. The game uses a <a data-ref-id="3025-2" href="/halo/3025-2" slug="halo">Halo</a>-style <span>recharging shield</span>, but if you get hit once while your shields are out, it's game over.</div><br/><div>The upgrades in PowerUp Forever are automatic. You'll get a manual shield that can be used to absorb or reflect bullets. Your default cannon will get a wider spread, and you'll also get two more weapons. There's a laser targeting device that shoots homing missiles when it locks and a plasma weapon that's essentially a <a data-ref-id="3025-330" href="/star-trek/3025-330" slug="star-trek">Star Trek</a>-style photon torpedo. I typically stuck with the default weapon and did just fine. As you blast enemies, you refill your secondary weapon gauge, which is used for the plasma, the laser, and a screen-clearing smart bomb. Saving up for the smart bomb and dropping it at the beginning of a guardian fight gives you the upper hand right away and seemed like the best way to handle business. But you eventually reach a maximum level of upgrade for all of your weapons. Once you've gotten all of the "real" power-ups, you just start getting an extra meter full of bonus energy as an "overcharge." If that meter is already full when you kill a guardian, you get nothing. No power-ups.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1111/420453-950925_20080715_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-420453" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1111/420453-950925_20080715_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-420453"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1111/420453-950925_20080715_screen004.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Everything changes color from level to level.</figcaption></figure>The game keeps score and has a score multiplier system in place that rewards you for quickly moving from one guardian fight to the next. You can also unlock bonus modes, such as a survival mode that doesn't give you any power-ups (!!!) and keeps track of how long you stay alive, a guardian rush that figures out how long it takes you to beat a set of bosses, a shield-only mode, and overkill mode. In overkill, you start out with every single power-up and have an infinite secondary weapon meter, letting you just fly around and hammer on the smart bomb button, like, forever. There's no challege to it and it feels like... oh... hey... it feels like overkill! So at least that part's aptly-named.</div><br/><div>OK, I'll stop harping on the name. It's not that big of a deal. PowerUp Forever is a pretty good dual-joystick shooter that stands out, even though there are now around a billion of these games available on various digital download services. If you felt that Flow was too soft, or that you wanted more guns in the first stage of Spore, you'll certainly dig it.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22478/]]></api_detail_url><id>22478</id><name><![CDATA[PowerUp Forever]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/powerup-forever/3030-22478/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-12-16 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-79951/]]></api_detail_url><id>79951</id><name><![CDATA[PowerUp Forever]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/powerup-forever-review/1900-96/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-97/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Meteos Wars has all the pieces it needs to be a great puzzle game, but with no online competition, it's all kind of pointless.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/611622-meteos05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-611622" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/611622-meteos05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-611622"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1570/611622-meteos05.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Picking your race is more than just an aesthetic choice.</figcaption></figure>Meteos Wars is the Xbox Live Arcade version of <a data-ref-id="3010-1508" href="/q-entertainment/3010-1508" slug="q-entertainment">Q Entertainment</a>'s DS puzzle game, <a data-ref-id="3030-10385" href="/meteos/3030-10385" slug="meteos">Meteos</a>. There's nothing extra warlike about this version of the game, though there's something to be said for not just calling it "Meteos Live." In the transition from DS to 360, the game's touch screen controls are, obviously, lost. It controls better with a stylus, so that's sort of a knock against it, but the standard gamepad controls certainly suffice, so it's still a solid, stylish addition to the block-dropping wing of the puzzle genre.</div><br/><div>In Meteos, different colored blocks continually drop into your well. You interact with them by sliding them up and down and attempting to match three or more blocks of the same color either vertically or horizontally. When you do this, the matched blocks turn into rocket boosters and blast off towards the top of the screen. How far they get depends on different factors, such as the size of the launch, the number of blocks that are also being lifted off screen, and the gravity of the planet you're playing on. If a launch fails to get blocks off the screen, you can adjust blocks in your slowly descending pile to relaunch them from mid-air. Forming combos like this builds up the force of a launch, making it easier to clear the screen. In most of the modes, you're competing against an opponent of some kind, so launching blocks off the screen sends them to your opponent's pit. You'll pick an alien before beginning, which dictates the distribution of colored blocks and which special attack or defense move you can pull off after filling an on-screen meter. The special attacks include shields to prevent you from receiving enemy blocks, lasers that disrupt your oppoent's screen, and so on.</div><br/><div>The DS version of the game let you scrub the blocks up and down via the stylus. As the 360 doesn't, like, have one of those, you'll have to make do with either the two analog sticks or the D pad and a pair of buttons that move your selected block up or down. It works pretty well. The 360 version has the same sort of mission modes that let you compete against a variety of different aliens, and you'll unlock more playable races for your own use as you play. You can, in theory, play the game against human opponents. Locally, that's not an issue. Online, the game is a wasteland and no one seems to be playing it. I managed to get two online games going, both against players in foreign countries, and both of them were so choppy and lagged that it wasn't worth playing. Meteos is a wildly competitive game, and it's a shame that the online is so barren.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/611619-meteos02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-611619" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/611619-meteos02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-611619"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1570/611619-meteos02.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Competition is the game's best aspect, but it's impossible to find any online.</figcaption></figure>In addition to the competitive modes, there are also some attack modes where you play for a minute and see how many points you can earn, or a timed mode that tracks how long it takes you to launch 100 blocks. The game has online leaderboards for these modes. Also, you can unlock little accessories for your aliens, like a heart or a big hunk of meat that you can stick to their forehead. I went with the meat. The game has a strong visual style to it, with cute, simple shapes used to depict the different aliens and lots of different music to keep things pumping.</div><br/><div>But it's difficult to overcome the lack of online competition out there. While the mission mode and various attack modes can certainly keep you occupied for a time, Meteos' real legs come from human competition. Unless you're planning on playing with friends and don't care about random encounters in ranked matches, Meteos Wars is pretty tough to recommend.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23617/]]></api_detail_url><id>23617</id><name><![CDATA[Meteos Wars]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/meteos-wars/3030-23617/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-12-23 15:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-79950/]]></api_detail_url><id>79950</id><name><![CDATA[Meteos Wars]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/meteos-wars-review/1900-97/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-98/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Animal Crossing: City Folk is a quality product, for sure, but it's also largely the same quality product that has already appeared on the DS and GameCube.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8207/279568-933195_20080715_screen016.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-279568" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.2971741112124" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:129.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8207/279568-933195_20080715_screen016.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-279568"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8207/279568-933195_20080715_screen016.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Jingle just rolled through for the Christmas celebration. I got a big clock!</figcaption></figure>Animal Crossing: City Folk is the same heartsy-folksy town wandering simulation that Animal Crossing always has been. You'll catch fish, dig up fossils, owe scads of bells to the company store, buy a mess of new furniture, and plant trees. While it's not identical to the previous game, Wild World for the DS, it's close enough that a lot of the longtime Animal Crossing faithful may find themselves finally reaching their breaking point with the series. But if you've never played an Animal Crossing before... or if you at least skipped the DS installment and haven't played one in a good, long time, you'll probably find the experience to be just as charming and engrossing as I did when I first played it back in 2002.</div><br/><div>Animal Crossing is a very roundabout sort of game. It opens with you moving to a new village. You'll be the only human in a town full of walking, talking animals, but that never really seems to come up. Along the way you'll make friends with the other residents and run errands for them. You'll also be able to go fishing, catch bugs, dig up fossils, pick fruit or grab shells for money, and spend your income on larger houses, new clothes, more furniture, and other various bric-a-brac. There's no real requirements here, so you can do as much or as little of these things as you like. And there's no real condition for "winning" the game. You simply play until you've gotten your fill.</div><br/><div>There's a simple allure to Animal Crossing because there's always something more for you to be doing. You could be working on tracking down a very specific set of furniture, or maybe you're trying to find every one of the game's rare paintings so you can have a completely full museum. Also, the game isn't necessarily time-consuming, either. You could play it for 20-30 minutes a day a few times a week and get a lot out of it. Of course, if you're more obsessive, you can spend a bit more time than that on it. But at that point, you're so focused on raking in money that you're more worried about watering red turnips and planting fruit trees in easy-to-scavenge patterns that you probably wouldn't even have time to read this review in the first place.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/245671-animalcrossing_cityfolk_screen010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-245671" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.548" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:54.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/245671-animalcrossing_cityfolk_screen010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-245671"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/245671-animalcrossing_cityfolk_screen010.jpg"/></a><figcaption>You can fish around for stuff, talk to neighbors, or just sort of aimlessly wander.</figcaption></figure>Money--bells, in the local parlance--is a big motivating factor in Animal Crossing. At the heart of it is local shopkeeper, Tom Nook. Nook sets you up with a house and a mortgage that you can chip away at on your own time. Once you've paid him off, he'll offer to upgrade your house so it can hold more stuff, sending you spiraling back into debt. Building up a stack of bells is what lets you buy more furniture, clothes, and other stuff to put in that house, so it's sort of a perpetuating cycle of upgrades and item hoarding. Eventually, though, your house tops out and can't be further upgraded. So you'll have to start thinking more about style and quality over quantity. Yes, at the core of Animal Crossing lies an interior decorating simulator that grades you for things like item rarity and placement. The crazy part is that it manages to make interior decorating fun and rewarding in a way that made me ask a lot of very hard questions about myself... back in 2002.</div><br/><div>That's sort of the problem. Six years later, very little has changed about Animal Crossing. The things I've written so far could apply to any of the games in the series. The Wii game does, however, gain a new city area that you can visit. Here you'll find a few shops, a fortune teller, a barber shop, a place where you can attempt to auction off your extra items, and a theater where you can learn different emote animations. Those emotes only really mean anything when you're playing with other people, though.</div><br/><div>Yes, like Wild World before it, City Folk does have an online component. After exchanging game-specific friend codes, one player can open the town gate to allow up to three other players to connect. This makes the animals in your town aware of your friends' town, and inhabitants may swap towns. Each town also has one of a handful of fruit types that are native to that town, so getting some foreign fruit and planting it in your own town is a good way to bring in extra cash. The game has support for (and optionally comes bundled with) the Wii Speak microphone, which is a piece of hardware that sits on top of your TV or shelf or something and mics your entire room so you can freely voice chat with connected players. In my time with it, I found the microphone to sound tinny, with a lot of echo. It probably depends on the shape and size of the rooms being used.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/10530-AC_Tom_Nook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10530" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.2835051546392" data-width="194" style="width: 194px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:128.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/10530-AC_Tom_Nook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10530"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/27/10530-AC_Tom_Nook.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/27/10530-AC_Tom_Nook.jpg"/></noscript></a><figcaption>TOM NOOK WANTS HIS MONEY</figcaption></figure>So what's wrong with Animal Crossing: City Folk? It's the things that could have been improved that make the Wii version kind of disappointing. Even if Nintendo's increasingly irrational fear of open online gaming with strangers isn't going to change, it'd still be nice if the game wasn't restricted when playing online. For whatever reason, there are some things you simply can't do when another person is in your town, like working with your own personal designs for shirts, umbrellas, and the like. Your inventory space is limited to the point of stifling what you're able to accomplish before running back to Tom Nook's to sell stuff, or back to your house to drop stuff off. Even your basic tools, like your shovel, bug net, and watering can, take up inventory slots. It's ridiculous that this hasn't been streamlined. But yeah, for the most part, it's the same game with a couple of new twists and somewhat better graphics. The same things that were annoying on the GameCube or DS are annoying here, only slightly more so because they keep putting the game out without improving things.</div><br/><div>That's why Animal Crossing: City Folk, and your enjoyment of it, comes down to your perspective. If you've never played an Animal Crossing game before, you'll probably love its charm and get lost in all the different tasks you can perform. And if you've stayed away from the series for any serious length of time, you'll probably still be able to enjoy yourself. But the formula hasn't changed, and for a lot of repeat players, it'll probably wear thin quickly.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21096/]]></api_detail_url><id>21096</id><name><![CDATA[Animal Crossing: City Folk]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/animal-crossing-city-folk/3030-21096/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-12-29 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73849/]]></api_detail_url><id>73849</id><name><![CDATA[Animal Crossing: City Folk]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>3</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/animal-crossing-city-folk-review/1900-98/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Wii]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-99/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[Crash Commando takes the conventions of the modern first-person shooter and puts them into a side-scrolling game, resulting in a fast-moving shooter that successfully merges old and new.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<div><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/488278-950927_20080716_screen009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-488278" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.57142857142857" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/488278-950927_20080716_screen009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-488278"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/488278-950927_20080716_screen009.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Control or capture points are helpfully marked with letters.</figcaption></figure>Crash Commando is multiplayer shooter that breaks from the standard first-person or behind-the-back camera conventions and takes things back to 2D as a side-scroller. It's hard to call it innovative, since it's essentially a better-looking take on a relatively obscure independent PC game called <a data-ref-id="3030-13773" href="/soldat/3030-13773" slug="soldat">Soldat</a>, but you certainly won't find much else like it on the PlayStation 3. Crash Commando is fast, frantic fun with enough maps and modes to keep the action feeling fresh for a good amount of time.</div><br/><div>In Crash Commando, you play as a tiny dude with a jet pack, so you can jump as well as boost around the game's levels. The jet pack has a limited amount of fuel, but quickly recharges when not in use. This means you can't just hover forever, but you won't have to constantly keep tabs on a fuel gauge, either. Prior to spawning, you choose which weapons you'd like to have. The arsenal has a number of primary weapons, including a standard assault rifle, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a rocket launcher, and so on. You can also choose between a pistol or a knife as a secondary attack, as well as picking grenades, C4, or mines as an explosive weapon. Fire control is handled via the right analog stick. You can aim in all directions and fire with the R2 button while moving around with the left stick. The control feels nice and tight.</div><br/><div>You'll apply these basic mechanics, along with the ability to hop in a couple of vehicles, across eight maps in a few different modes. Obviously, you've got standard deathmatch and two-team deathmatch options. There's also an objective-based mode that has you defending or capturing specific points. Up to 12 players can play in a single game, and online, some of those slots can be filled by bots if you don't have enough humans. You can also create offline games with bots, but overall, the AI guys aren't too bright, and can only be used in deathmatch or team deathmatch games. You're better off finding real people.</div><br/><div><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/488282-950927_20080716_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-488282" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.57142857142857" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/488282-950927_20080716_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-488282"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/488282-950927_20080716_screen004.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Vehicles give you a layer of armor, but it's nothing a few well-placed shots can't fix.</figcaption></figure>Online is where the game really starts to take shape. The action is fast and, despite the game's classic 2D looks, there's certainly some strategy involved. That's mostly thanks to the map design, which gives you plenty of ways to get to a specific location, forcing a defending enemy to consider all of the breach points and giving attackers a good reason to come at things from different angles, and with different weapons. The game also gives players good reasons to stay alive, as you can earn up to three bonuses--like recharging health, for example--for surviving and taking out enemies.</div><br/><div>While Crash Commando features little characters, the graphics manage to be lush and expressive. You'll fight through various indoor areas, as well as out in jungles or ruins, and so on. Also, when the little guys get killed, they pop into a mess of bloody pixels that constantly satisfies. The gun fire sounds appropriately meaty and the music is the standard sort of military stuff that you'd expect to hear. Overall, it presents itself well.</div><br/><div>Aside from inadequate bots and the resulting lackluster solo play, it's hard to go wrong with Crash Commando. It's a great merging of modern shooter concepts with classic movement styles and camera perspectives that I found to be both engaging and fun... even if the whole thing sort of just made me want to reinstall Soldat on my PC.</div>]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22951/]]></api_detail_url><id>22951</id><name><![CDATA[Crash Commando]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/crash-commando/3030-22951/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2008-12-31 16:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-80212/]]></api_detail_url><id>80212</id><name><![CDATA[Crash Commando]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Jeff]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/crash-commando-review/1900-99/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></platforms></review><review><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-100/]]></api_detail_url><deck><![CDATA[The foul-mouthed humor remains equally well-spoken and vulgar, though the formula is starting to become apparent with Episode Two.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628786-paa_episode_two_dialogue_balls.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628786" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628786-paa_episode_two_dialogue_balls.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628786"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/495/628786-paa_episode_two_dialogue_balls.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Yup, this is a Penny Arcade product alright!</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id="3010-6333" href="/hothead-games/3010-6333" slug="hothead-games">Hothead Games</a> and the creative forces at Penny Arcade seem to have established their rhythm with the second episode of their serialized <a data-ref-id="3015-2534" href="/steampunk/3015-2534" slug="steampunk">steampunk</a> action-adventure RPG. It's mechanically unchanged from the first episode, and it's roughly the same basic size and shape. It's all just as structurally sound, but it's apparent now that the gameplay, as lively as it can be, is a delivery mechanism for Penny Arcade's deeply referential brand of humor. It's rare that a game aims primarily to make you laugh, and Penny Arcade: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode Two is pretty good at it. <br/><br/>With the peculiar setting of <a data-ref-id="3035-49" href="/new-arcadia/3035-49" slug="new-arcadia">New Arcadia</a> already in place, the bulk of the story in this episode revolves around discovering the origins of the massive <span><span>Fruit Fucker</span> Prime</span> that demolished your house at the beginning of the first episode, before you got roped into all that lunacy with robot-building <span>hobos</span> and magical <span>mimes</span>. There are plentiful callbacks to the events of the first episode, and a couple of the major characters from that arc pop up in supporting roles here, making room for new characters like the unironically named roboticist <span>Dr. Jonathan Crazoir</span>, and <span>Dr. Wolfington</span>, huntsman extraordinaire and corrupt proprietor of the <span>Cloying Odor Sanitarium</span>. There's also a brief, drug-induced appearance by Penny Arcade faves <span>Twisp</span> and <span>Catsby</span>. You'll fight <span>giant <span>spiders</span></span>, cause trouble in the impossibly monied part of town, attend a suffocatingly cliquish scientific symposium, and take part in the auspicious and storied tradition of <span>robot monkey</span> fights. <br/><br/>Absurdist juxtapositions are Penny Arcade's bread and butter, so it's unsurprising that Episode Two relies pretty heavily on alternating between deliberately straightforward blue language and clever word-smithery for its humor. While it's arguably a little filthier than Episode One, it doesn't feel lazy about how it gets its laughs. What's interesting about the structure of the storytelling here is how successful it is as both a standalone game experience and a smaller segment of a larger story. Once you finish up the six-or-so hours that Episode Two demands, you'll have accomplished some grand, fairly satisfying feats that bring a good amount of closure while keeping you excited about what Episode Three has to offer.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628787-screenshot_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628787" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.6259765625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628787-screenshot_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628787"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/495/628787-screenshot_1.jpg"/></a><figcaption>It's difficult to say if this gameplay can sustain two more episodes.</figcaption></figure>For all the farm-fresh chuckles that Episode Two provides, the gameplay beneath it all hasn't really changed. It's probably unreasonable to expect significant mechanical advancements between episodes, but the simplicity that made the quasi-real-time combat so immediately engaging in Episode One is starting to wear a little thin. There's still a certain hypnotic quality to the combat, but at a point it turns into something to do while you wait for the next bit of hilarity. There are other technical aspects that, without the newness of Episode One, are becoming a little more glaring. Long load times when hopping from one location to the next do the game no favors, particularly since it's something that you'll be doing a lot of. The polygonal interpretations of the Penny Arcade art style are generally awkward, and the sound design remains oddly spartan, save for a few pieces of orchestrated music and a preponderance of stock Wilhelm-style hawk screeches. <br/><br/>On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness is shaping up to be a four-episode arc, and while I have no doubt that the Penny Arcade team has enough silly, vulgar material to power through the back half, I'll be curious to see how well the gameplay stands up. Between the quality of the content and the release schedule so far, this is probably one of the finest examples of episodic video gaming out there, though it's still susceptible to one of the format's implicit pitfalls--if it doesn't stay interesting, players won't keep coming back. For now, at least, the keen sense of silliness is enough to keep things interesting.]]></description><dlc/><dlc_name/><game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23689/]]></api_detail_url><id>23689</id><name><![CDATA[Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episode Two]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/penny-arcade-adventures-on-the-rain-slick-precipic/3030-23689/]]></site_detail_url></game><publish_date>2009-01-07 14:00:00</publish_date><release><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-79610/]]></api_detail_url><id>79610</id><name><![CDATA[Penny Arcade: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness: Episode Two]]></name></release><reviewer><![CDATA[Ryan]]></reviewer><score>4</score><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/penny-arcade-adventures-on-the-rain-slick-precipic/1900-100/]]></site_detail_url><platforms><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store, PC]]></platforms></review></results><version>1.0</version></response>
